| Launched in October 2022, the **Bioquanti** website was designed to contribute to reproducible and self-instructional teaching. *Reproducible teaching* is understood as an active teaching-learning methodology based on programming codes, inherited from Donald Knuth's concepts of [literate programming](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/27/2/97/343244?login=true) and *reproducible research*, and aimed at the production and sharing of *dynamic documents* and *teaching objects*. Originally designed for the study of topics in *Quantitative Biochemistry* with the aid of programming codes, the site now features content for basic education, also based on programming languages.

| In general, the *website* addresses the use of four programs, two developed at UNIFAL-MG: *JSPlotly* for interactive graphics and *AI* simulation, and *SISMA* for dynamic observation of the structure and interaction of elements in networks. The other open-source programs include the use of the *R & RStudio* platform for graphics, analysis, tables, simulations, and animations, and *Jmol* for the study and three-dimensional visualization of atomic models. Part of the detailed content of the portal, as well as its application to higher education, can be viewed in an article in the [Journal of Biochemistry Education](https://www.bioquimica.org.br/index.php/REB/article/view/1058). 


| Essentially, the website aims to provide tools and tutorials for the use of **computational thinking** focused on **programming logic** with the help of **programming languages**, directly applied to **curriculum content** through the execution, modification, and creation of codes for the construction and study of interactive objects for technical and scientific topics.
\

| In short... **code for content**.
\

| The portal provides access to freely distributed ebooks for studies in biochemistry and related fields, namely: [Visualização Dinâmica em Catálise & Metabolismo](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25027.92964), [Bioquímica Quantitativa & R](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36090.40644), and [Bioquímica Estrutural Guiada Por Jmol](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29268.10882), all with codes for reproduction.

| The website also provides access to the *ebook* [Bioquímica Básica, de Gente, de Bicho, e de Planta](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388790659_Bioquimica_basica_de_gente_de_bicho_e_de_planta) or its [digital version on the website](/nivel/superior/biqTxT/index_txt.qmd), a basic text for undergraduate students in the field, for reference to various contents, but without codes.

| For basic education, we suggest taking a look at the *ebook* [Vivificando Conteúdos para o Ensino Básico](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392460244_Vivificando_Conteudos_Para_o_Ensino_Basico_Moleculas_Graficos_e_Mapas_Interativos), an adaptation of part of the website's content for a smooth learning curve of *Jmol* and *R & RStudio*, directly applied to the construction of *interactive reproducible teaching objects (RITO*, or *OIER* in Portuguese) for school content.

## Recognition

| The website was awarded 2nd place in the *Bayardo Baptista Torres National Award for Teaching Biochemistry and Molecular Biology*, held every two years since 2017 by the *Brazilian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology* (SBBq, 2023), and is referenced as an open educational resource on the [eduCAPES portal](https://educapes.capes.gov.br/handle/capes/748598). Recently, a portable application for graphic and interactive simulation available on the website, *JSPlotly*, was awarded first place in the same award and is also available on [eduCAPES](https://educapes.capes.gov.br/handle/capes/972869). With equal honor and satisfaction, we also had works classified in the *National Award* in its previous editions, this time for experimental work in teaching and learning.

| *Bioquanti* currently offers topics for higher education in biochemistry, although due to its quantitative nature, it also includes content on *physical chemistry, chemistry, biophysics, descriptive and inferential statistics, experimental design, linear algebra, integral calculus, differential calculus, and computational modeling, among others*; The language is geared toward university professors and researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.

### **Bioquanti** for elementary and secondary education

| For elementary and secondary education, the website offers a set of instructional content and teaching objects for the last years of elementary school and high school. Its content was also designed according to the principles of *reproducible teaching* (RT) and involves interactive teaching objects for curricular content (*RITO*). 

|   In this sense, the website presents applications of the *JSPlotly* (simulator) and *GSPlotly* (code generator) platforms directly aimed at basic education content. The website also has a practical tutorial on using *Jmol* for 3D molecules and interactivity, and another for *R in the RStudio environment* for interactive graphics and maps. The tools are presented in their cloud versions, eliminating the need for installation or configuration, although there are instructions for installing the program on a computer. The tutorial is illustrated with examples taken from *MAPA (Pedagogical Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais - Brazil)*. The portal also provides a collection of interactive atomic models included in a *"Molecule Garden"* and a repository for interactive graphics and maps such as RITOs. The *Molecule Garden* is organized into classes and has a collection of atomic models for three-dimensional visualization and study.
