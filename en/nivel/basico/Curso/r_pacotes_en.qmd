## Why install packages?

| In a simple answer, because each of the more than 21,000 `R` packages has an extension of resources that `R` itself does not have in its original installation. In other words, it extends the tool for a specific purpose, such as *reproducing and even modifying code snippets that result in interactive teaching objects for basic education*. 

| For this, we will use only two packages, `plotly` and `leaflet`. This means that the interactivity packages need to be installed before the code can be executed. But don't worry. This is one of the easiest parts of working with `R`.


## Installing the `plotly` package in `R` 


1. Go to the *Packages* tab in *RStudio*.

2. Type the name of the package in the field (`plotly`), and click *Install*.

| Done! The package will be installed from the *RStudio* cloud server (whether on your computer or in the cloud), with some intermediate messages in red, as shown below.

## Loading the installed package

| `R` allows you to install a huge number of packages. But of course you won't use them all at the same time. So `R` needs to *"know"* which package you want at any given moment, which is done by the `library` command, illustrated below for the `plot_ly` package, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

| Done! Package installed and loaded!
| Now it's time to execute some code snippets for educational purposes.
