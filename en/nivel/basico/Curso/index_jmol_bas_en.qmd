title: "3D molecule visualization and animations - Jmol"

| There are several programs available for three-dimensional observation and study of atomic models, which can be accessed via computer, mobile devices, and even the internet. Some are free, others offer free trials, and others are paid.

| Here is a short list: 
[Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/), [Maestro](https://www.schrodinger.com/products/maestro), [iMolView](https://www.molsoft.com/iMolview.html), [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD), [MolView](https://molview.org/), [ChemSketch](https://www.acdlabs.com/resources/free-chemistry-software-apps/chemsketch-freeware/), and
[Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)
\


| Among these, [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/) is a multiplatform program (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix) developed in *Java*, which can be run either as a standalone computer program or in a browser. Unlike common programs, the computer version does not require installation, only the execution of a Java file. 
\


| Thus, Jmol can run either from a directory folder containing its files or from a hard drive or removable media (USB flash drive). In addition, it is a free source code and distribution program for representing three-dimensional molecular models, allowing a variety of views and colors, translation and rotation of molecules, visual magnification, calculations of distance, angles, structures, and surfaces, molecular optimizations, and animations, among others. There are a large number of websites that use *Jmol*, starting with the list available on the Wiki community page (http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/Main_Page).

In addition, *Jmol* can be accessed via the internet, without the need for files on your computer. Among the various websites that have the JSmol applet that allows this access, we suggest **clicking on the image below**, which will direct you to the applet on the St. Olaf College website (https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?), illustrating a water molecule:

## Jmol in Primary Education

| The following material aims to encourage the use of *Jmol* for interactive visualization and study of molecules in primary education. As an aid, images extracted from the notebooks of [MAPA (Educational Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais](https://seliga.educacao.mg.gov.br/cadernos-mapa-2025) will be used.
