## Now that the molecule is on the browser page, what can I do with it?

| A looooot!!!

| *Jmol* has a *menu* with several operations, hundreds of commands, and perhaps another hundred tutorials on the internet. For more direct and immediate structural observations, however, the operations can be summarized as follows:

- Mouse movements (rotation, translation, *zoom*)
- Model representations (ball and stick, filled space, wireframe)
- Colors (model and background)
- Measurements (distances and angles)
- Molecular characteristics (H bonds, van der Waals cloud, partial and effective charge)
- Surfaces (molecular, electrostatic)
- Atom selection and visualization (water, hydrogen)
- Animations (zoom, automatic rotation), cuts


## Saving the model on your computer or mobile device

| All actions performed on the molecule produce a new model that can be downloaded to your computer. This is really cool because the modified molecule (with changes in colors, representations, animations, for example) can be uploaded to *Jmol* or *JSmol* (internet) as already mentioned. To do this, you can use mouse clicks or command lines, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. Right click on the screen -> File -> Save -> Save as PNG/JMOL # by mouse
or...
2. write molecule_name.pngj # by command line in the Console
```


| **One of the impressive features of Jmol is that by saving the molecule as PNG/JMOL, you can open the file as a static image with a double click to just show the molecule, or drag the file to the Jmol window in your browser, which will load the three-dimensional and interactive structure of the model!!! **
\

<div class="reminder-markdown">

**Now it's up to you:**

1. Load a model for "phenol" by typing in the Console: `load $phenol`
1. Save the model by typing in the Console: `write phenol.pngj
2. Change the orientation of the model randomly with the mouse (just move it a little);
3. Locate the file `phenol.pngj` on your computer;
4. Open it as a normal image, just to test;
5. Now drag the file to the Jmol online window and see if the model replaces the previous one (just check the orientation)

### Some movements in Jmol

| To illustrate some actions, we will initially use the *vitamin C* model, loading it with the command below in the *Console*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load $ascorbate
```


## Mouse movements

| For *rotation and translation of the model, as well as magnification*:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
zoom - middle mouse button; if there is no middle button, Shift+left button; 

rotation - left mouse button

translation - Ctrl+right button

rotation on the axis - Shift+right button
```


## Representations of the model

| The representations refer to the visual aspect of the model (rendering), or its *style*. Thus, *Jmol* can render the model as *stick, wireframe, filled space, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon* (all in English, of course - *cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon*). 


| Try these styles, including the `only` option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute **on each separate line** the code snippet that follows in the *Jmol* *Console*, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.

\


```{r, eval = FALSE}

load $fluoxetine # loads the molecule
wireframe only # wireframe style
cpk only # filled space
cpk 20 only, bond 1 # balls and sticks
cartoon only # cartoon representation, but this does not occur with small molecules, only with biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, for example)

```


| Note also that the `cartoon` representation does not result in a rendering for the fluoxetine model. This is because *the `cartoon` representation is restricted to biopolymers only, i.e., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.*

| However, if you want to try `cartoon`, you will need to know the alphanumeric code for a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein in mammals (code: *1mcy*)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load=1mcy # loading myoglobin

# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from that used for small molecules
```

| Note that the default rendering for large molecules is *balls and sticks*, which is not very educational for learners. In this case, it can be represented as a unique drawing by typing:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
cartoon only # rendering as a drawing
```

| To obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, enter the [PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/) database and type the name in the search field (in this case, `myoglobin`). The system returns several structural models and their codes. Simply transcribe one of these codes to the *JSmol* *Console*.

## Colors

| There is great flexibility in [colors](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/jscolors/) for *Jmol* (and, consequently, for *JSmol*), both for entire models, parts of the model (specific atoms or a set), and the background. The default color display follows the [CPK (Corey–Pauling–Koltun)] convention (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPK_coloring). Using the previous vitamin C model (`load $ascorbate`) as an example, try the following variations separately:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
color pink
color blue
color ligthgreen
background yellow # background color
```

| The last command in the list above allows you to vary the background color.

| Additionally, it is also possible to color the bonds between atoms, as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
color bonds LightSeaGreen
```


| For a wide range of colors, you can consult the [Jmol Colors](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/jscolors/) reference, or a more "digestible" link, created by us while learning the program for higher education, in the [Biochemistry](nivel/superior/jmol/index_jmol.html) area, more specifically, the topic on colors for Jmol.
