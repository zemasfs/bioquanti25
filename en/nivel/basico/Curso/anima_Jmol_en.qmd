## Animate the molecules.


| And we have reached the last part of the *Course* with *Jmol*, to present a very interesting educational effect of the program: *molecule animation*.

| You may want to show a molecule with different styles during a certain period, or make a slow transition between colors in specific atoms, or even controlled enlargement, reduction, or rotation effects. And many others that your imagination and technical rigor allow you to study.

| In these cases, it is interesting to know and apply a few animation commands explained below. The examples have been selected to simplify each command. But don't be fooled by the capabilities of *Jmol*, because for each command there are always several complementary options. And if you want to know anything about any *Jmol* command, visit the [reference website](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/).


### Spin

| Simple command to rotate the molecule.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load $glucose; spin 30 # the value refers to the rotation speed
```


### ZoomTo (resize)

| This command is impressive because it allows for controlled magnification or reduction over time. Its syntax is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size
```

Examples:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
Increase by 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3 

Increase by 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400

Focus on a biopolymer ligand with 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0

Focus on a biopolymer ligand with 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4
```


### Delay

| This is a **key command** for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in *Jmol* to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the *Console* throughout a *script*.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
delay 3 # waits 3 seconds before the next action
```


| We can try out an animation with the above commands using the cyclohexanol model.

| Here is a code snippet for you to try out animations with *Jmol*. Just copy and paste it into the *Console* and run it. If you prefer to make any changes, it is best to copy it to a notepad, modify it, and test the *script* in the *Console*.


<div class="reminder-markdown">

**Now it's up to you:**

load $cyclohexanol
\
delay 2
\
spin Y 70
\
delay 2
\
spin off
\
zoomTo 2 \*2
\
cpk
\
delay 2
\
color transparent
\
zoomTo 2 \*0.5
\
spin 50
