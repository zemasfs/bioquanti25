title: "Jmol - Visualization of Molecular Models"

---

| [Jmol](http://jmol.sourceforge.net/){target="_blank"} is a free source code and distribution program for the representation of three-dimensional molecular models, offered under the GLPL (GNU Lesser General Public License). Jmol allows a variety of chromatic renderings, translation and rotation movements of molecules, visual magnification, calculations of distances, angles, structures and surfaces, molecular optimizations, and animations, among others.

| The program is multiplatform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Unix) developed in Java environment, and can be executed both in closed version (standalone), as well as integrated with other Java applications, or even with internet search engines with the help of an *applet.* When installed, *Jmol* can run both from a directory folder containing its files, as well as from a hard disk or removable media (*pendrive*).

| The contents developed with *Jmol* for **Biochemistry** and related topics can be viewed in [Structural Biochemistry Guided by Jmol](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388790369_Bioquimica_Estrutural_Guiada_Por_Jmol). This is a work for autonomous learning of the main molecular structures in *Biochemistry*, prepared in an itemized format, and allowing progressive monitoring of the topics covered with the help of the viewer.

| The models contained in the **ebook** are obtained from this [**LINK**](figBook\figures.html){target="_blank"}, separated by chapters of the *ebook*, or in [single compressed file (zip)](figBook/figBook.zip), containing the renderable images. The figures can be opened in any image viewer in static form, or rendered three-dimensionally by *Jmol*.

## Quick usage tip!

| *Jmol* is accessed *online* by several *Structural Biology* sites, such as [First Glance in Jmol](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/fgij/){target="_blank"} from *Proteopedia*, or [St. Olaf College](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/simple.htm){target="_blank"}.

| This [**quick tutorial**](https://youtu.be/NnO4oytvvjk){target="_blank"} in *video* illustrates a tip for another site as well.

| So, just go to the [link](https://proteopedia.org/wiki/fgij/){target="_blank"}, right-click on the empty space (*canvas*), search for *File-\>Load-\>Open from PDB*, and type in a code from the online database [*Protein Data Bank*](https://www.rcsb.org/){target="_blank"} such as *5cyt* (cytochrome C).
| On the other hand, if you wish to study any figure from the [ebook](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388790369_Bioquimica_Estrutural_Guiada_Por_Jmol), download the desired file from the [link](.\figBook\figuras.html){target="_blank"} image library and drag it to the [FGJM](https://www.bioinformatics.org/firstglance/fgij/){target="_blank"} window to automatically render the structure in 3D.
