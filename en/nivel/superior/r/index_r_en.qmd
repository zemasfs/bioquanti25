| [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is free software developed for statistical computing and graphics. *R* runs on several user interfaces (GUI), among which [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) stands out, an integrated development environment (IDE) that is also free. *Rstudio* also has a free *online version*, accessible through the [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) website.

| The *R & RStudio* platform can be used in a virtually unlimited way for various fields of knowledge. Among these are the *Natural Sciences* and, in particular, *Biochemistry*, *Molecular Biology*, *Biophysics*, and related areas.
\

## Biochemistry

| To access the content developed with **R** and **RStudio** for **Biochemistry** and related topics, you can either download the *ebook* [Quantitative Biochemistry & R](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388877308_Bioquimica_Quantitativa_R), or access the individual topics below. 

| This allows you to reproduce the activities in any topic covered by simply clicking on the upper right corner of the code snippet containing a copy icon ![ copy ](icon_copiar.png){width=2%}, and pasting it into an installed session of *RStudio*, or in its *online* version [RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/). This [**quick tutorial**](https://youtu.be/LF99kO8DE6Y){target="\_blank"} in *video* illustrates the tip.

| There are many features that enable the use of *R & RStudio* for teaching and learning in *Biochemistry*. Some of these features reside in *Reproducible Research* [@gandrud2018reproducible], which is briefly guided by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1) Availability of original data;
2) Existence of a code to process and analyze this data;
3) Documentation of data and code, enabling reproducibility;
4) Distribution and accessibility of the code.
```


| In this sense, the production of texts, tables, graphs, data analysis, and simulations can be perfectly adjusted to **teaching-learning** through the use of such principles and the simultaneity of text and code, touching on **Reproducible Teaching**. This approach allows the reader to study the various topics covered through reading and interpretation, as well as to gain a more convergent understanding through the execution, modification, and creation of codes relevant to each topic. In this work, these concepts are applied to the *quantitative content* and *mathematical relationships* of the topics covered in *Biochemistry*. 

![](rlogo_bg.png){width="10%"}

| These relationships are present in **Biochemistry textbooks** and cover, for example, **titration curves of weak acids and amino acids**, the study of **effective charges in biomolecules**, **physical-chemical characteristics of proteins and nucleic acids** predicted by sequence analysis, **enzyme kinetics and their inhibition**, **thermodynamic quantities and bioenergetics**, **ligand-biopolymer interaction**, **stoichiometry of biochemical reactions**, **biochemical pathways and metabolic networks**, among others.
| In general, the above topics are covered in this material with the help of *R & RStudio*. However, its content does not intend to go beyond a superficial treatment of the use of *R*, *RStudio*, or even the proposed topics in *Biochemistry*. For these, traditional sources of tutorials, textbooks, and the internet are recommended. Nor does it venture into the universe of *Bioinformatics*, traditional or structural, such as *Systems Biology*, *sequence alignment*, *structural prediction*, *molecular modeling, dynamics, and docking*, or the various facets of *omic studies*.
| In summary, the objective is only to address the *quantitative content* and *mathematical relationships* present in part of *Biochemistry*, as described above, using *R & Rstudio*. This approach touches on **problem solving and simulations using linear systems of equations, linear algebra, linear, nonlinear, polynomial, and multiple linear regression, optimization, minimization, simple differential equations, and sequence analysis**, among others.
| Secondarily, the objective is to allow the reader to reproduce calculations, graphs, and/or tables relevant to the listed content by repeating or modifying simple code snippets and scripts.
