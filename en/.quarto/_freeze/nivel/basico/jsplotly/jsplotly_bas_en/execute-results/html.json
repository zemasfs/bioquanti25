To get the most out of each topic, try following the suggestions for *parametric manipulation* in each topic.\n\\\n\n## Instructions {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Choose a topic;\n2. Click on the corresponding graph;\n3. Click on \"Add Plot\";\n4. Use the mouse for interactivity and/or edit the code.\n\nReminder: the editor uses infinite undo/redo in the code (Ctrl+Z / Shift+Ctrl+Z)!\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n## Mathematics\n\n### Context - Trigonometry (EM13MAT306, EM13MAT308, EM13MAT307) {.unnumbered}\n\n| The following simulation aims to facilitate the visualization of some concepts in trigonometry, *sine, cosine, and tangent*. The code allows you to use a *drop-down menu* for each trigonometric function, as well as a *slider* to change the frequency in radians.\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n**1. Sine function:**\n\n$$\ny = \\sin(\\omega x)\n$$\n\n**2. Cosine function:**\n\n$$\ny = \\cos(\\omega x)\n$$\n\n**3. Tangent function:**\n\n$$\ny = \\tan(\\omega x)\n$$\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/trigonom.png)](Eq/jsp_trigonom.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Select the sine, cosine, and tangent functions using the drop-down menu.\n2. Try changing the frequency of the function using the slider.\n3. Overlay a sine graph and a cosine graph to observe their differences.\n4. Repeat the same for the tangent graph.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Financial Mathematics\n\n### Context - Compound Interest (EM13MAT402): {.unnumbered}\n\n| Also known as *“interest on interest”*, compound interest adds value to capital over time, resulting in the growth of the final amount.\n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nM = C \\cdot (1 + i)^t\n$$\n\n\n*Where,*\n\n- M: final amount\n- C: initial capital\n- i: interest rate per period (in decimal)\n- t: number of periods (e.g., months)\n\n[![](Eq/juros.png)](Eq/jsp_juros.html)\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Vary the contract period, the monthly interest rate, or the initial amount.\n2. Try combining the parameters in the variation.\n3. Evaluate the visual difference between an investment and a loan by entering a positive initial capital value for the former and a negative value for the latter.\n4. Observe the downward curve for a simulated loan with negative initial capital. The remaining values refer to the outstanding debt to pay off the loan.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Statistics\n\n### Context - Normal distribution curve (EM13MAT316, EM13MAT407, EM13MAT312)  {.unnumbered}\n\n\n| Sampling and population are common topics for data observation in analytical procedures. Statistical distribution curves for this involve the *t-Student*, *F-Snedecor*, *Chi-square*, and *normal distribution*. The normal distribution curve reflects the statistical behavior for natural phenomena in a given data population.\n\n| The example aims to illustrate the use of the *z* transformation, the calculation of critical values, and the interpretation of the area under the curve in the study of normal distribution and statistical inference.\n\n\n### Equation {.unnumbered}\n\n| The density function of the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is given below?\n\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\, e^{ -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} }\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n- $\\mu$ = 0 (mean of the distribution);\n- $\\sigma$ = 1 (standard deviation);\n- *x* = continuous random variable;\n*f* = normal distribution density function\n\n\n| From the equation above, we can extract *z*, the value of the standardized random variable for zero mean and unit standard deviation, representing the value on the x-axis:\n\n\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\n\n\n\n[![](Eq/estat.png)](Eq/jsp_estat.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Try changing the value of “p” and running the graph. This value represents the probability of observing, under the null hypothesis, a value as extreme or more extreme than the observed value — that is, it measures the evidence against the null hypothesis. In the graph, it represents the area under the normal curve in the critical regions, indicating the chance of the observed result occurring by pure chance.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Physics\n\n### Context - Elastic potential energy (EM13CNT102, EM13CNT202, EM13MAT402)\n\n| The deformation of an elastic material is directly proportional to the force exerted on it and limited to the properties of the material.\n\n### Equation {.unnumbered}\n\n| The behavior of an ideal spring is described by Hooke's law below:\n\n\n\n$$\nF = -k*x\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- F = restoring force of the spring (N);\n- k = spring constant (N/m);\n- x = deformation (m).\n\n| On the other hand, the *elastic potential energy* involved is described by the following quadratic relationship:\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}*k*x^2\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- E = elastic potential energy (J).\n\n[![](Eq/fisica2.png)](Eq/jsp_fisica2.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Try changing the value of the sprin´s elastic constant to highlight its effect, relating it to stiffer or less stiff springs;\n2. Change the spring´s deformation limits in the code´s \"control structure\" (e.g., \"for (let x = -0.7)\"), and observe the effect on the maximum potential energy;\n3. Note that, due to the quadratic operation on the deformation value, the potential energy is always positive.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Context - Motion of bodies (EM13CNT102): {.unnumbered}\n\n| The following code illustrates the trajectory of an oblique launch with an angle adjustable by a slider, useful for exploring the concepts of kinematics.\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n**1. General equation**\n\n$$\ny(x) = x \\cdot \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{g}{2 v_0^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)} \\cdot x^2\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- y(x): height as a function of horizontal distance;\n- x: horizontal position (m);\n- $\\theta$: angle of launch relative to the horizontal (radians or degrees);\n- v0: initial velocity of the projectile (m/s);\n- g: acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²$^{2}$)\n\n**2.

Change the initial velocity in the code and observe the effect on the graph.\n3. Simulate a \"lunar condition\" for the trajectory, with gravity around 1/6 that of Earth (~1.6 m/s²).\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Chemistry\n\n### Context - Heat Capacity (EF09CI06, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203) {.unnumbered}\n\n| The following simulation aims to observe the relationship between heat exchanged (*Q*), mass (*m*), heat capacity (*c*), and temperature variation (*$\\Delta$T*).\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n$$\nQ = c \\cdot m \\cdot \\Delta T\n$$\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/cp.png)](Eq/jsp_cp.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.
