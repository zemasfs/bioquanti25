Originally designed for the study of topics in *Quantitative Biochemistry* with the aid of programming codes, the site now features content for basic education, also based on programming languages.\n\n| In general, the *website* addresses the use of four programs, two developed at UNIFAL-MG: *JSPlotly* for interactive graphics and *AI* simulation, and *SISMA* for dynamic observation of the structure and interaction of elements in networks. The other open-source programs include the use of the *R & RStudio* platform for graphics, analysis, tables, simulations, and animations, and *Jmol* for the study and three-dimensional visualization of atomic models. Part of the detailed content of the portal, as well as its application to higher education, can be viewed in an article in the [Journal of Biochemistry Education](https://www.bioquimica.org.br/index.php/REB/article/view/1058). \n\n\n| Essentially, the website aims to provide tools and tutorials for the use of **computational thinking** focused on **programming logic** with the help of **programming languages**, directly applied to **curriculum content** through the execution, modification, and creation of codes for the construction and study of interactive objects for technical and scientific topics.\n\\\n\n| In short... **code for content**.\n\\\n\n| The portal provides access to freely distributed ebooks for studies in biochemistry and related fields, namely: [Visualização Dinâmica em Catálise & Metabolismo](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25027.92964), [Bioquímica Quantitativa & R](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.36090.40644), and [Bioquímica Estrutural Guiada Por Jmol](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.29268.10882), all with codes for reproduction.\n\n| The website also provides access to the *ebook* [Bioquímica Básica, de Gente, de Bicho, e de Planta](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388790659_Bioquimica_basica_de_gente_de_bicho_e_de_planta) or its [digital version on the website](/nivel/superior/biqTxT/index_txt.qmd), a basic text for undergraduate students in the field, for reference to various contents, but without codes.\n\n| For basic education, we suggest taking a look at the *ebook* [Vivificando Conteúdos para o Ensino Básico](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392460244_Vivificando_Conteudos_Para_o_Ensino_Basico_Moleculas_Graficos_e_Mapas_Interativos), an adaptation of part of the website's content for a smooth learning curve of *Jmol* and *R & RStudio*, directly applied to the construction of *interactive reproducible teaching objects (RITO*, or *OIER* in Portuguese) for school content.\n\\\n\n\n| The website was awarded 2nd place in the *Bayardo Baptista Torres National Award for Teaching Biochemistry and Molecular Biology*, held every two years since 2017 by the *Brazilian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology* (SBBq, 2023), and is referenced as an open educational resource on the [eduCAPES portal](https://educapes.capes.gov.br/handle/capes/748598). Recently, a portable application for graphic and interactive simulation available on the website, *JSPlotly*, was awarded first place in the same award and is also available on [eduCAPES](https://educapes.capes.gov.br/handle/capes/972869). With equal honor and satisfaction, we also had works classified in the *National Award* in its previous editions, this time for experimental work in teaching and learning.\n\n<!-- ::: {layout-ncol=5} -->\n\n<!-- [![](premio1lugar_bg.png)](https://www.bioquimica.org.br/index.php/REB/announcement/view/57) -->\n\n<!-- [![](premio2lugar_bg.png)](https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/reuniao-2023.html) -->\n\n<!-- [![](premio1lugar2019_bg.png)](https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/bayardo2019.html) -->\n\n<!-- [![](premio2lugar2017_bg.png)](https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/premiobayardo2017.html) -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<div class=\"d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-center gap-3\">\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bioquimica.org.br/index.php/REB/announcement/view/57\">\n  <img src=\"premio1lugar_bg.png\" alt=\"Prêmio 1º lugar\" style=\"max-width:100px; height:auto;\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/reuniao-2023.html\">\n  <img src=\"premio2lugar_bg.png\" alt=\"Prêmio 2º lugar\" style=\"max-width:100px; height:auto;\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/bayardo2019.html\">\n  <img src=\"premio1lugar2019_bg.png\" alt=\"Prêmio 1º lugar 2019\" style=\"max-width:100px; height:auto;\">\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www2.sbbq.org.br/reuniao/premiobayardo2017.html\">\n  <img src=\"premio2lugar2017_bg.png\" alt=\"Prêmio 2º lugar 2017\" style=\"max-width:100px; height:auto;\">\n</a>\n\n</div>\n\n\n| *Bioquanti* currently offers topics for higher education in biochemistry, although due to its quantitative nature, it also includes content on *physical chemistry, chemistry, biophysics, descriptive and inferential statistics, experimental design, linear algebra, integral calculus, differential calculus, and computational modeling, among others*; The language is geared toward university professors and researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.\n\\\n\n### **Bioquanti** for elementary and secondary education\n\n| For elementary and secondary education, the website offers a set of instructional content and teaching objects for the last years of elementary school and high school.

The tools are presented in their cloud versions, eliminating the need for installation or configuration, although there are instructions for installing the program on a computer. The tutorial is illustrated with examples taken from *MAPA (Pedagogical Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais - Brazil)*. The portal also provides a collection of interactive atomic models included in a *\"Molecule Garden\"* and a repository for interactive graphics and maps such as RITOs. The *Molecule Garden* is organized into classes and has a collection of atomic models for three-dimensional visualization and study. \n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](logo-bioquanti_fullname.png){width=\"40%\" fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n\n| Launched in October 2022, the **Bioquanti** website was designed to contribute to reproducible and self-instructional teaching. *Reproducible teaching* is understood as an active teaching-learning methodology based on programming codes, inherited from Donald Knuth's concepts of [literate programming](https://academic.oup.com/comjnl/article-abstract/27/2/97/343244?login=true) and *reproducible research*, and aimed at the production and sharing of *dynamic documents* and *teaching objects*.
