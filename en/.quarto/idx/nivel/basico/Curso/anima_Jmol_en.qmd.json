Its syntax is:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE} \nIncrease by 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3 \n\nIncrease by 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4\n```\n\n\n### Delay\n\n| This is a **key command** for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in *Jmol* to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the *Console* throughout a *script*.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ndelay 3 # waits 3 seconds before the next action\n```\n\n\n| We can try out an animation with the above commands using the cyclohexanol model.\n\n\n![Cyclohexanol structure.
