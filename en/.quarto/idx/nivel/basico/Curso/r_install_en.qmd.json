In practice, you download both programs and install them as you would any other program, whether for Windows, Linux, or Mac. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) website and download the R program. ![](rstudioSite.png)\n\n2. Install the program with the default options.\n\n3. On the same website, [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), look a little further down for the installer that is most appropriate for your operating system.\n\n\n\n![](rstudioInstala.png)\n\\\n\n3.

The interface is practically the same as the computer installation. Among some advantages, the speed is usually higher for running and installing packages, since the server is already in the cloud. But because it is *online*, it requires an initial registration with a *login and password*. Follow these steps:\n\\\n\n1. Access the [RStudio Cloud](https://login.posit. cloud/login?redirect=%2Foauth%2Fauthorize%3Fredirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fposit.cloud%252Flogin%26client_id%3Dposit-cloud%26response_type%3Dcode%26show_auth%3D0).\n\n![](rstudioNuvem.png)\n\n\n2.
