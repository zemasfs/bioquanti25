In other words, it extends the tool for a specific purpose, such as *reproducing and even modifying code snippets that result in interactive teaching objects for basic education*. \n\n| For this, we will use only two packages, `plotly` and `leaflet`.

Type the name of the package in the field (`plotly`), and click *Install*.\n\n![](pacotes.plotly.png)\n\n| Done!

But of course you won't use them all at the same time. So `R` needs to *\"know\"* which package you want at any given moment, which is done by the `library` command, illustrated below for the `plot_ly` package, as follows:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n\n| Done! Package installed and loaded!\n| Now it's time to execute some code snippets for educational purposes.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n<div class = \"reminder-objetivos\">\nObjectives:\\\n1.
