This is called *multivariate data*. To illustrate this situation, let's say we want to provide various information in a graph showing the relationship between a country's gross domestic product and the life expectancy of its inhabitants over time. \n\\\n\n\n![Some economic indicators associated with life expectancy in 2001. Source: MAPA: high school - Human sciences and their technologies. 1st semester, 2nd year, p.101.](expectativa_mapa.png)\n\n| To illustrate the interactive richness that can be obtained by `plotly` on the influence of *gross domestic product - GDP* on life expectancy, we can import a data set from the internet and create a graph on this relationship, see:\n\\\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtaining data from the internet\nurl <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida <- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpVida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # name of the per capita income column in the data\ny = ~lifeExp, # name of the life expectancy column in the data\ntype = 'scatter', # graph type (scatter)\nmode = 'markers' # scatter type (points)\n)\n```\n\\\n\n| Done! Simple, straightforward, and interactive code. If you hover your mouse over the points, you will see the coordinates of GDP and life expectancy. However, it is not possible to tell from this graph who is who, i.e., which country has which GDP, as well as other information contained in the original spreadsheet downloaded from the internet. To give you an idea, *this spreadsheet contains, in addition to GDP and life expectancy values, the country and its population, the continent to which it belongs, as well as the year the data was measured*. \n\\\n\n| Thus, we are faced with a set of *multivariate data*, which is very common in various databases, such as [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/) or [DATASUS](https://datasus.saude.gov.br). \n\\\n\n| How about if we could present everything at once, i.e., GDP, life expectancy, the country, the size of the population, the continent, and the year in which all of this was measured, i.e., **six** variables, including *numerical* and *categorical* (classes) variables?\n\\\n\n| Impossible?! Not for `R`!! Here is a snippet of code for that, with the proposed result. Don't worry about the size or details. If you want to **reproduce** this code, you know what to do... just copy, paste, and run the code in an `R` script.\n\\\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtendo os dados na internet\nurl <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida <- url  # atribuindo os dados a um objeto do `R`\n\n# Criando o gráfico interativo com animação\nplot_ly(\n  dadosExpVida, # dados convertidos da internet\n  x = ~gdpPercap, # renda per capita\n  y = ~lifeExp, # expectativa de vida\n  size = ~pop, # tamanho dos pontos em função da população\n  color = ~country, # cor dos pontos em função do país\n  frame = ~year,    # Frame para a animação por ano de coleta dos dados\n  text = ~continent,  # País como informação ao passar o mouse\n  hoverinfo = \"text\",\n  type = 'scatter', # tipo de gráfico\n  mode = 'markers',\n  marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7)\n) %>%\n  layout(  # atribuição de título e etiquetas dos eixos\n    title = \"Produto interno bruto X Expectativa de vida\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"PIB (log), US$\", type = \"log\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Expectativa de Vida, anos\"),\n    showlegend = TRUE # possibilidade ou não de aparecer a legenda\n  ) %>%\n  animation_opts(\n    frame = 1000,           # Velocidade da animação\n    transition = 0,\n    redraw = TRUE\n  )\n```\n\\\n\n| To go to the \"*playground*\" now, click *PLAY* and observe the temporal transition of life expectancy as a function of countries' GDP. And note that all other data is there, separated by point size (population), color (country), continent (*hover*, *mouse* over), and year (animation frame or *frame*)! \n\\\n\n| One more detail! If you look at the legend, you will see that it is also *sliding*, identifying each country by color. Want to know where Brazil is in this crazy graph of GDP and life expectancy? Easy. Find Brazil in the legend, double-click, and notice that now only that point is highlighted.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n<div class = \"reminder-objetivos\">\nObjectives:\\\n1.
