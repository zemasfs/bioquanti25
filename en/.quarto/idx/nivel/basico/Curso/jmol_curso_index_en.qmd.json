If you are using it on your computer or laptop, or even from a removable media (*flash drive*), you can access it by downloading, unzipping, and running the `Jmol.jar` file located in the main folder on the [Jmol website](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/).\n\n| Now, if you don't want to install anything, you can also access it *online* from various sites. In this *Course*, we will use a very famous one, adapted from one of the program's developers. Just click on this [*link*](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=water) in a new tab.\n\n\n| Alternatively, **throughout this Course, you can copy the code from any example by clicking on the *\"folder\"* icon to the right of each shaded area. Done! The code is copied to the clipboard. Now just paste it somewhere (notepad or Jmol)**.

Or rotate the middle mouse button, or perform pinch and zoom gestures with two fingers on the touchpad.
