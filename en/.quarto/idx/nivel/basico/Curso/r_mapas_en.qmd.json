Because it is a map, the information is obtained in specific geographic coordinates. This feature therefore makes it essential to have the longitude and latitude coordinates related to the geographic points you want to display.\n\n| Here is a simple example, locating the three municipalities in southern Minas Gerais where the campuses of the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG) are located.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ncities <- data.frame(\nname = c(\"Alfenas\", \"Varginha\", \"Poços de Caldas\"),\nlat = c(-21.42943530, -21.539957, -21.783731), # Latitude\nlon = c(-45.95948212, -45.433960, -46.564178) # Longitude\n)\n\n# Create the interactive map\nplot_ly(\ndata = cities,\nlat = ~lat,\nlon = ~lon,\ntype = 'scattergeo',\nmode = 'markers+text',\ntext = ~name,\nmarker = list(size = 10, color = 'blue', opacity = 0.7),\ntextposition = \"top center\") %>%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Municipalities of UNIFAL-MG campuses\",\ngeo = list(\nscope = 'south america',\nshowland = TRUE\n)\n)\n```\n\n\n| To view the municipalities, zoom in on the image with your mouse. Note that the map starts in South America, a condition inserted in the code to facilitate the search for cities. Try placing a comment (*#*) to the left of the section \"*scope = ...\"*, and the information will start from the *mundi* map. Now notice that when you hover your mouse over the municipalities, the proposed geographic coordinates are identified.\n\\\n\n<div class=\"reminder-markdown\">\n\n**Now it's your turn:**\n\n1. Locate the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of your hometown or that of a loved one. To do this, search the internet;\n2. Copy the code above and paste it into a new script; \n3. Replace the attributes *\"name\"*, *\"lat\"*, and *\"lon\"* in the `data.frame` of the code with the ones you found.\n4.

To illustrate this, let's import a spreadsheet on global oil production. This category includes crude oil, shale oil, tar sands, condensates, and natural gas liquids (ethane, LPG, and naphtha separated from natural gas production).\n\nAt the same time, we will filter the imported data for the year 2014, as found in the [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets) database. \n\n\n![World oil production.
