For more direct and immediate structural observations, however, the operations can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Mouse movements (rotation, translation, *zoom*)\n- Model representations (ball and stick, filled space, wireframe)\n- Colors (model and background)\n- Measurements (distances and angles)\n- Molecular characteristics (H bonds, van der Waals cloud, partial and effective charge)\n- Surfaces (molecular, electrostatic)\n- Atom selection and visualization (water, hydrogen)\n- Animations (zoom, automatic rotation), cuts\n\n\n## Saving the model on your computer or mobile device\n\n| All actions performed on the molecule produce a new model that can be downloaded to your computer. This is really cool because the modified molecule (with changes in colors, representations, animations, for example) can be uploaded to *Jmol* or *JSmol* (internet) as already mentioned. To do this, you can use mouse clicks or command lines, as follows:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Right click on the screen -> File -> Save -> Save as PNG/JMOL # by mouse\nor...\n2. write molecule_name.pngj # by command line in the Console\n```\n\n\n| **One of the impressive features of Jmol is that by saving the molecule as PNG/JMOL, you can open the file as a static image with a double click to just show the molecule, or drag the file to the Jmol window in your browser, which will load the three-dimensional and interactive structure of the model!!! **\n\\\n\n<div class=\"reminder-markdown\">\n\n**Now it's up to you:**\n\n1. Load a model for \"phenol\" by typing in the Console: `load $phenol`\n1. Save the model by typing in the Console: `write phenol.pngj\n2. Change the orientation of the model randomly with the mouse (just move it a little);\n3. Locate the file `phenol.pngj` on your computer;\n4. Open it as a normal image, just to test;\n5. Now drag the file to the Jmol online window and see if the model replaces the previous one (just check the orientation)\n\n</div>\n\n\\\n\n\n### Some movements in Jmol\n\n| To illustrate some actions, we will initially use the *vitamin C* model, loading it with the command below in the *Console*.\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nload $ascorbate\n```\n\n\n## Mouse movements\n\n| For *rotation and translation of the model, as well as magnification*:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nzoom - middle mouse button; if there is no middle button, Shift+left button; \n\nrotation - left mouse button\n\ntranslation - Ctrl+right button\n\nrotation on the axis - Shift+right button\n```\n\n\n## Representations of the model\n\n| The representations refer to the visual aspect of the model (rendering), or its *style*. Thus, *Jmol* can render the model as *stick, wireframe, filled space, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon* (all in English, of course - *cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon*). \n\n\n| Try these styles, including the `only` option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute **on each separate line** the code snippet that follows in the *Jmol* *Console*, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.\n\\\n\n\n![Fluoxetine structure.

This is because *the `cartoon` representation is restricted to biopolymers only, i.e., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.*\n\n| However, if you want to try `cartoon`, you will need to know the alphanumeric code for a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein in mammals (code: *1mcy*)\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nload=1mcy # loading myoglobin\n\n# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from that used for small molecules\n```\n\n| Note that the default rendering for large molecules is *balls and sticks*, which is not very educational for learners. In this case, it can be represented as a unique drawing by typing:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ncartoon only # rendering as a drawing\n```\n\n| To obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, enter the [PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB](https://www.rcsb.org/) database and type the name in the search field (in this case, `myoglobin`). The system returns several structural models and their codes.

The default color display follows the [CPK (Corey–Pauling–Koltun)] convention (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPK_coloring). Using the previous vitamin C model (`load $ascorbate`) as an example, try the following variations separately:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ncolor pink\ncolor blue\ncolor ligthgreen\nbackground yellow # background color\n```\n\n| The last command in the list above allows you to vary the background color.\n\n| Additionally, it is also possible to color the bonds between atoms, as follows:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ncolor bonds LightSeaGreen\n```\n\n\n| For a wide range of colors, you can consult the [Jmol Colors](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/jscolors/) reference, or a more \"digestible\" link, created by us while learning the program for higher education, in the [Biochemistry](nivel/superior/jmol/index_jmol.html) area, more specifically, the topic on colors for Jmol.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n## Now that the molecule is on the browser page, what can I do with it?\n\n| A looooot!!!\n\n| *Jmol* has a *menu* with several operations, hundreds of commands, and perhaps another hundred tutorials on the internet.
