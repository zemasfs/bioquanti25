The representation is in a pie chart, and the selection by decade is in a drop-down menu.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/linguag_pizza.png)](Eq/linguag_pizza.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. You can use the mouse to hover over each bar to see the \"tip\" (hint) for that data point in the chart.\n```\n\n\n### Context - Frequency of words in text (EM13LGG101, EM13LGG302, EM13LGG303) {.unnumbered}\n\n\n[![](Eq/linguag2.png)](Eq/jsp_linguag2.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\n1. Try replacing the code text with another;\n2. Try varying the number of most frequent terms in the variable \"const entradas\" (optionally, also vary in the graph title, to make sense);\n3. Compare a text in Portuguese with its translation into English or another language.\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Art\n\n### Context - Pitch, harmony, and timbre (EF15AR06, EM13ARH402) {.unnumbered}\n\n| The following example illustrates the concepts of pitch (frequency), harmony, and timbre (pure waves and harmonics) for a graph of musical tones (diatonic scale). \n\n[![](Eq/musica.png)](Eq/jsp_musica.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n### Suggestion\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Test other keys (C, G, D, etc.), observing how the pure wave appears when the graphs are superimposed;\n2. Evaluate the difference between a pure wave and one produced with musical instruments, involving natural harmonics. To do this, replace the Boolean option \"false\" with \"true\" in the variable \"const ondaComposta\".\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"jsplotly_bas_en.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
