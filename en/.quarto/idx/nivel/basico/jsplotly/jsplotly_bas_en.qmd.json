Try using the mouse scroll wheel and the \"pan\" icon on the top bar to interact with the map.\n```\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n### Context - Distribution of slaves in the Americas from 1500 to 1888 (EF08HI06, EM13CHS104, EM13CHS503): \n\n| This simulation presents an interactive *bar chart* for selecting a period from a *drop-down menu*, tangent to the estimated number of enslaved Africans landed in the main regions of the Americas. The data are rough estimates to illustrate the visualization potential of the application, although they serve as a starting point for more accurate educational discussions. Sources for consultation include [Slave Voyages](https://www.slavevoyages.org/past/database/african-origins).\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/escravos.png)](Eq/jsp_escravos.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Try switching between periods in the drop-down menu, comparing estimates of slave traffic;\n2. Select a period, create the graph, select another period, and add another graph. This allows you to compare the number of slaves brought in by the double bars formed, and hover your mouse over each bar.\n\n```\n\n### Context - Timeline of events in the Middle Ages (EM13CHS101, EM13CHS102) \n\n\n[![](Eq/hist2.png)](Eq/jsp_hist2.html){target=“_blank”}\nSource: [Encyclopedia.com](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/timeline-events-middle-ages?)\n\n### Suggestions: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Try changing events and periods in the code, and assign them to another period in human history.\n```\n\n\n## Languages\n\n### Context - Slang spoken in Brazil from 1980 to 2020 (EF89LP19, EM13LGG102) \n\n| This simulation is intended to estimate the use of slang spoken in Brazil over the last 40 years. The representation is in a pie chart, and the selection by decade is in a drop-down menu.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/linguag_pizza.png)](Eq/linguag_pizza.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. You can use the mouse to hover over each bar to see the \"tip\" (hint) for that data point in the chart.\n```\n\n\n### Context - Frequency of words in text (EM13LGG101, EM13LGG302, EM13LGG303) \n\n\n[![](Eq/linguag2.png)](Eq/jsp_linguag2.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\n1. Try replacing the code text with another;\n2. Try varying the number of most frequent terms in the variable \"const entradas\" (optionally, also vary in the graph title, to make sense);\n3. Compare a text in Portuguese with its translation into English or another language.\n\n```\n\n\n<!-- ### Context - Pitch, harmony, and timbre (EF15AR06, EM13ARH402)  -->\n\n<!-- | The following example illustrates the concepts of pitch (frequency), harmony, and timbre (pure waves and harmonics) for a graph of musical tones (diatonic scale).  -->\n\n<!-- [![](Eq/musica2.png)](Eq/jsp_musica3.html){target=“_blank”} -->\n\n<!-- ### Suggestion -->\n\n<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->\n<!-- 1. Test other keys (C, G, D, etc.), observing how the pure wave appears when the graphs are superimposed; -->\n<!-- 2. Evaluate the difference between a pure wave and one produced with musical instruments, involving natural harmonics. To do this, replace the Boolean option \"false\" with \"true\" in the variable \"const ondaComposta\". -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n## Arts\n\n### Context - Music notation editor (EF15AR06, EF69AR22, EM13ARH402)\n\n| The following example illustrates the concepts of pitch (tonality) and duration for musical notes in the diatonic scale. The captions represent the duration values, and the tonalities are presented in their frequency values\n\n[![](Eq/musica2.png)](Eq/jsp_musica3.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Try changing the melodic sequence of the code in the corresponding vector;\n2. Try changing the duration figures in the corresponding vector\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n## STEAM\n\n### Context - Pottery wheel (EM13MAT101, EM13MAT403, EM13CNT204, EM13AR01, EM13AR02) \n\n| The platform also allows creations for integration in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (*STEAM*). Here is an example of a simulation for ceramic turning and manual clay molding, which allows you to experiment with symmetrical and rounded shapes, such as vases, bowls, and pots, by adjusting some parameters and the trigonometric functions of the code.\n\n[![](Eq/steam.png)](Eq/jsp_steam.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Change the height of the vase, its shape, and its colors by editing the code in the specific fields.\n```\n\n\n### Context - Mini CAD (EM13MAT301, EM13MAT503, EM13MAT402)\n\n| Here is an example of code for manipulating 3D geometric shapes (curves or lines) when creating a mini CAD (*Computer-Aided Design*).\n\n\n[![](Eq/miniCAD)](Eq/jsp_miniCAD.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Try changing the base, height, and curvature parameters of the code, also varying the sign of the values (positive, negative);\n2. Change a trigonometric function (lineX or lineY, sine to tangent, for example), and overlay it on the plot;\n3. Overlay geometric figures with different color palettes.\n4. Create symmetrical figures by overlaying a curve with a positive parameter on one with the same negative parameter.\n```\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"jsplotly_bas_en.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
