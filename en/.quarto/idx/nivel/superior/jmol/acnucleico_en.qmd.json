Alternatively, you can download the original file *4v42* from *Jmol* itself. But note that if you try to do it through *Menu*, *Get PDB*, you will not be successful. For this model, you need to download the file from the PDB website, in *PDBx/mmCIF Format (gz)* format. This is necessary because it is a file subdivided into two structures, 30S and 50S subunits. In addition to these, the bacterial ribosome has a hexanucleotide segment of m-RNA complexed with three t-RNAs.\n\n| The model shows three t-RNAs inside (blue-red), a large set of proteins (dark gray), and the remaining nucleic structure (orange). The 70S ribosome is quite complex, with several sites, both for interaction with t-RNA (A, P and E) and for interaction with protein subunits. To find out how many of these, type *show info*, and you will see that the structure has 49 polypeptide chains.  At the terminal part of t-RNAs, the nearby A and P sites define the site of peptidyl transferase activity on the ribosome.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!-- Google tag (gtag.js)-->\n\n\n```{=html}\n<script>\nwindow.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\nfunction gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}\ngtag('js', new Date());\n\ngtag('config', 'G-S1L73VGCG5');\n</script>\n```\n\n| The difference between the composition of the **DNA** (deoxyribonucleic acid)\\index{DNA} molecule and that of **RNA** (ribonucleic acid)\\index{RNA} lies in two main aspects.

The length of an H-bond lies between 2 and 4 Angstrom.\n\n| To check the potential for forming an *H* bond between the carbohydrates above, right-click, select \"Measurements\" (or its translation, if you are in your native language) and \"Click for distance measurement\". Now click on the first desired atom (2'-OH) and then on the one that has the potential to form the pairing (O-49). And remember that 1 nm is equal to 10 Angstrom.\n\n| In general, the base-base, base-sugar, base-phosphate, sugar-sugar, and sugar-phosphate pairings contribute as *H* bonds to the stability of t-RNA.\n\n| Now visualize *a Watson-Crick pairing*, albeit with the *G* and *C* residues in non-helical portions of the t-RNA, by typing:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nselect all;color lightgrey;wireframe;hbonds off # model cleaning\nselect 19 or 56;color red\n```\n\n| To observe the importance of base interactions for the **tertiary structure**\\index{t-RNA tertiary structure} of the t-RNA type:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nhbonds off;backbone only;\ncolor structure;\nselect 18 or 55;color orange;\nwireframe 100;\nhbonds on;hbonds 0.3\n```\n\n| tRNA interacts with amino acid transporters by **triplets**\\index{triplets} of codons in its structure (or trinucleotides). Highlighting the GGC triplet:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nselect all;hbonds off;wireframe only;\ncolor lightgrey;select (9,13,22,46);wireframe 80;\ncolor cpk\n```\n\n## Ribosomes\n\n| For a structural study of **ribosomes**, download and load the [30S subunit](./figures/30S.png){target=\"_blank\"}\\index{30S subunit} of the ribosome of *Thermus thermophilus*. Distinguish the nucleic from the protein structures:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ncartoon only;select nucleic;color green; select protein;color orange\n```\n\n| Is the structure represented \"more RNA\" or \"more protein\"? Try to visualize it by rotating the model by:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nselect all;spacefill only\n```\n\n| Is the protein structure unique? To solve this question, rotate the structure from:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nselect all;select nucleic;color cpk;\nselect protein;color chains\nspin 10\n```\n\n| And how does the nucleic part fold?\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nrestric rna\n```\n\n| Observe the spherical shape and the nuclear characteristic of the RNA, to which the various proteins that form the 30S subunit are complexed.\n\n### 70S ribosomal particle\n\n| To observe it, download and load into *Jmol/JSmol* the model of the [70S particle](./figures/70S.png){target=\"_blank\"}\\index{70S subunit} of *Thermus thermophilus* complexed to m-RNA and t-RNA. Alternatively, you can download the original file *4v42* from *Jmol* itself. But note that if you try to do it through *Menu*, *Get PDB*, you will not be successful. For this model, you need to download the file from the PDB website, in *PDBx/mmCIF Format (gz)* format. This is necessary because it is a file subdivided into two structures, 30S and 50S subunits. In addition to these, the bacterial ribosome has a hexanucleotide segment of m-RNA complexed with three t-RNAs.\n\n| The model shows three t-RNAs inside (blue-red), a large set of proteins (dark gray), and the remaining nucleic structure (orange). The 70S ribosome is quite complex, with several sites, both for interaction with t-RNA (A, P and E) and for interaction with protein subunits. To find out how many of these, type *show info*, and you will see that the structure has 49 polypeptide chains.  At the terminal part of t-RNAs, the nearby A and P sites define the site of peptidyl transferase activity on the ribosome."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"output-file":"acnucleico_en.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
