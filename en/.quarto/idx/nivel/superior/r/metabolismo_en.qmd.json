However, metabolic pathways are classified for better understanding into subsets of reactions relevant to a certain group of nutrients or biological compounds, such as carbohydrates, lipids and nucleic acids, for example.\n| And in a broader view of these subsets, a further classification results in several sequential and interdependent biochemical reactions, the so-called *metabolic pathways or routes*. These metabolic pathways summarize *catabolic* or *anabolic* processes involving substrates, products, enzymes, cofactors and coenzymes, as illustrated in *glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, citric acid cycle, respiratory chain, pentose pathway, *fatty acid beta-oxidation, among others.\n| Thus, a metabolic pathway can be considered as a *linear combination of enzymatically catalyzed reactions* (e.g. anaerobic glycolysis).

Thus, one can use *matrix relations* to solve the stoichiometric balance (mass and charge), obtaining the final net reaction from a set of known reactions. In short, *biochemical equations* as *matrix equations* [@alberty1991chemical].\n\n## Matrix operation\n\n| By applying linear algebra, it is possible to obtain the final balance of sequential reactions by the following relation, also seen in the *Biothermodynamics* chapter:\n\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & ... & a_{1n} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & ... & a_{2n} \\\\\na_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & ... & a_{3n} \\\\\n... & ... & ... & ... & a_{jn}\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} ,\\\nb =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nb_1 \\\\\nb_2 \\\\\nb_3 \\\\\n... \\\\\nb_n \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} ,\\\ny =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ny_1 \\\\\ny_2 \\\\\ny_3 \\\\\n... \\\\\ny_n \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-mtrxGlic}\n\n| In this case, *A* represents the *stoichiometric matrix of reactions* and compounds, *b* the *metabolic pathway vector*, and *y* the balanced *net reaction vector*. The pathway vector indicates the number of times each reaction must occur to produce the final net reaction. Matrix *A* is arranged in such a way as to present each reaction in each column and each reactant in each row, filling it with the *stoichiometric coefficients* of reactants and products. For these, it is necessary to present a positive sign for products (they are formed) and a negative sign for reactants (they are consumed).\n| The matrix operation to obtain the net reaction involves only a cross product, such as:\n\n$$\nA * b = y\n$$ {#eq-eqMtrxDot}\n\n### Obtaining the metabolic pathway vector for aerobic glycolysis:\n\n| Assuming that we know the summarized net reaction for a set of metabolic reactions, such as aerobic glycolysis (in turn including anaerobic glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation), we can easily obtain the pathway vector. From this calculated pathway vector, we can obtain the final net reaction of the more detailed set of reactions. In practice, this detailing involves the participation of oxidation-reduction coenzymes, ADP, ATP, and Pi.\n\n| For example, consider the reactions below, related to a glycolysis synthesis [@alberty1996calculation]:\n\n$$\nglucose \\rightleftarrows 2\\,pyruvate \\\\\npyruvate + CoA \\rightleftarrows acetyl \\, CoA + CO_2\nacetyl \\, CoA + 3 H_2O\n\\rightleftarrows 2 CO_2+CoA\n\\frac{1}{2} O_2 \\rightleftarrows H_2O\n$$ {#eq-eqGlicoSimp}\n\n$$\nacetyl \\, CoA + 3 H_2O\n\\rightleftarrows 2 CO_2+CoA\n\\frac{1}{2} O_2 \\rightleftarrows H_2O \\\\\n$$\n\n| The sequential reactions above have as a net resulting reaction:\n\n$$\nglucose + 6O_2 \\rightleftarrows 6 CO_2 + 6 H_2O\n\n$$ {#eq-eqGlicoSimpFin}\n\n| To obtain the route vector, it is necessary to elaborate the matrix relation, such that:\n\n$$\nA =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1/2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-mtrxGlicSimp}\n\n$$\ny =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n6 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n6 \\\\\n-6 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$ {#eq-mtrxGlicSimp2}\n\n| Thus, the solution for the route vector is:\n\n$$\nb = A^{-1} * y\n$$ {#eq-eqMtrxGlicSimp}\n\n| It turns out that the linear system for the set of equations of the glycolytic pathway is overestimated (there are more equations than unknowns), not allowing the solution by the `solve` function directly, as illustrated in the *Biothermodynamics* chapter.
