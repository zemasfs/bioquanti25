If we zoom in on any of the biochemical reactions involved in this complex web, we can identify a *black box* common to all of them:\n\n```{r, blackb, echo=FALSE, fig.align =\"center\", out.width=\"40%\", fig.cap=\"A representation of the black box of enzymatic reactions. E = enzyme c,d = cofactors, coenzymes, modifiers; f,g = secondary compounds resulting from catalysis.\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/blackbox.png\")\n```\n\n| Although the representation above may involve equilibrium reactions (double arrows), or even the absence of a catalyst, the image generalizes individual biochemical reactions that are part of any *metabolic map*. If we now wish to evaluate the consumption of compound *A* (reactant, substrate) and the resulting formation of compound *B* (product), that is, the levels of the compounds in a time interval, we can consider, as seen in the chapter on *Enzymes*), the reaction above as 1st order in both reactant and product:\n\n$$\nA\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k}\\\\\n\\rightarrow \\\\\n^{}\\end{array} B\n$$ {#eq-ABirrev}\n\n| Thus, the reaction rate can be considered as the variation of *A* or *B* over time as:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{dy}{dx}=-\\frac{dA}{dt}=\\frac{dB}{dt}\n$$ {#eq-dydx}\n\n| In other words, when there is consumption, the rate of variation is negative, and when there is formation, it is positive. Separating the two rates:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt}= -k*A;\\\\\n\\frac{db}{dt} = k*B\n$$ {#eq-dAdt}\n\n| And thus, to calculate the variation in each compound over a time interval:\n\n$$\ndA=-k*A*dt;\\\\\ndB=k*A*dt\n$$ {#eq-dAdB}\n\n| Note that we are dealing with a *system of differential equations*, nominally *ordinary*, since the changes in time occur as a function of a single parameter (species concentration). If it were a system dependent on more than one parameter, we would be dealing with *partial* differential equations (common in thermodynamic relations that involve changes with variations in volume, temperature, and pressure).\n| Some differential equations can be solved analytically, such as those involving bacterial exponential growth:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=-k*N; \\, N(t) = N_0*e^{-kt}; (N=N_0 \\,em \\, t=0)\n$$ {#eq-expDecay}\n\n## Numerical solution for a system of differential equations\n\n| On the other hand, when an equation or system of differential equations has a certain complexity for the analytical solution, the numerical solution is sought. Although there are several libraries for solving differential equations using `R` (`deSolve`, `pracma`, `lsoda`), some simple systems can be solved using the basic installation packages:\n| The simplest procedure uses the *Euler method*. The basic idea of ​​the method consists of integrating a differential function of infinitesimal variation in the independent variable (in this case, time), for a real relation, and from given initial values. Simply put, the value of the function will correspond to the increase of the increment *dy* for each interval *dx*, from the relation of each reaction involved in the transformation of the compounds. Example for the reactions present in @eq-dAdB:\n\\\n\n```{r, fig.cap = \"Solution of system of differential equations by Euler method for 1st order conversion of species A into B, at a kinetic rate k.\"}\n\n# Solution of differential equations for conversion A-->B\n\nk <- 0.5 # kinetic constant of catalysis\ndt <- .005\ntmax <- 3 # time interval & maximum time\nt <- seq(0, tmax, dt) # time vector\nn <- tmax / dt + 1 # no. of simulation points (it is necessary to add 1 so that the vectors have the same size) \nx <- matrix(rep(0, 2 * n), nrow = 2, ncol = n) # construction of the matrix of one row for each compound, and one column for each time dt \nx[1, 1] <- 1 \nx[2, 1] <- 0 # initial concentration values \nfor (i in 2:n) { \n  dA <- -k * x[1, i - 1] * dt # dA \n  dB <- k * x[1, i - 1] * dt # dB \n  x[1, i] <- x[1, i - 1] + dA # variation in A with increase in dA x[2, i] <- x[2, i - 1] + dB # variation in B with increase in dB # loop that adds the value of the new content to each interval dt composite\n}\nplot(t, x[1, ],\ntype = \"l\", lty = 1,\nxlab = \"time, s\", ylab = \"[species], M\", ylim = c(0, 1.025),\nbty = \"l\"\n) # plot of composite 1\nlines(t, x[2, ], lty = 2, col = 2) # add plot of composite 2\nlegend(\nx = 2, 5, y = 1, legend = c(\"A\", \"B\"), col = c(1, 2),\ncex = 1, lty = c(1, 2)\n)\n```\n\n| Experiment with varying the kinetic constant *k*, or the initial values ​​for each compound, and observe the resulting effect. Metabolic reactions often present interconversions between compounds, such that a substrate of the reaction can also be configured as a product of catalysis of the same, and with kinetic rates of synthesis (*k*) and degradation (*km*, or *k minus*) for each compound, as follows:\n\n$$\nA \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{km} \\end{array} B\n$$ {#eq-ABrever}\n\n| In this case, the system of differential equations will be:\n\n$$\ndA=-k*A*dt+km*B*dt;\\\\\ndB=k*A*dt-km*B*dt\n$$ {#eq-dABrev}\n\n| Implementing the code snippet in `R`:\n\n```{r,fig.cap=\"Numerical solution for the reversible conversion of species A into B. k = km = 0.5; Ao and Bo = 1 (initial contents).\"}\nk <- 0.5\nkm <- 0.5 # kinetic constants of catalysis\ndt <- .005\ntmax <- 10 # time interval & maximum time\nt <- seq(0, tmax, dt) # define time vector\nn <- tmax / dt + 1 # define no. of points\nx <- matrix(rep(0, 2 * n), nrow = 2, ncol = n) # build a matrix with one\n# row for each compound, and one column for each time dt\nx[1, 1] <- 1\nx[2, 1] <- 1 # initial concentration values\nfor (i in 2:n) {\ndA <- -k * x[1, i - 1] * dt + km * x[2, i - 1] * dt\ndB <- k * x[1, i - 1] * dt - km * x[2, i - 1] * dt\nx[1, i] <- x[1, i - 1] + dA\nx[2, i] <- x[2, i - 1] + dB\n# loop that adds to each interval dt the new concentration value for\n# each compound\n}\nplot(t, x[1, ],\ntype = \"l\", lty = 1,\nxlab = \"time, s\", ylab = \"[species], M\", ylim = c(0, 2), bty = \"l\"\n) # graph of compound 1\nlines(t, x[2, ], lty = 2, col = 2) # addition of graph of compound 2\nlegend(\nx = 2, 5, y = 2, legend = c(\"A\", \"B\"), col = c(1, 2), cex = 1,\nlty = c(1, 2)\n)\n```\n\n| Note that the amounts of A and B remain constant throughout the interval.
