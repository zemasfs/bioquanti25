How much protein/ligand is present?\n2. How much of the complex is formed?\n3. How fast does the complex associate/dissociate?\n4. What are the mechanisms involved?\n\n| In general, the ligand-protein interaction can be represented as follows:\n\n$$\nP+L \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k_{on}}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{k_{off}} \\end{array} PL\n$$ {#eq-diagPL}\n\nWhere *P* represents the free protein content, *L* the free ligand, and *PL* the formed complex. The reaction rates are defined for the formation (*k$_{on}$*; M$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and dissociation (*k$_{off}$*; s$^{-1}$) of the complex.\n\n| Thus, the equation for the *interaction isotherm* of the ligand with the protein is deduced as follows:\n\n$$\nKd=\\frac{[P]*[L]}{[P]+[L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqPL}\n\nWhere *Kd* represents the *equilibrium dissociation constant* for the formed *PL* complex, as conditioned on the formation/dissociation equilibrium of the complex (*v$_{assoc}$ = v$_{dissoc}$*), and also defined as:\n\n$$\nKd=\\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}\n$$ {#eq-eqKd}\n\n| From @eq-eqPL one can easily deduce the final expression for the interaction of a ligand to a set of sites of the same affinity on the protein:\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\frac{n * [L]}{Kd + [L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqNu}\n\n## Interaction Models and Linear Representations\n| Note that @eq-eqNu practically repeats the formalism already seen with the formation of the activated enzyme-substrate complex from the *Enzymes* chapter, as well as its resulting representation as a quadratic hyperbola. In fact, it essentially replaces the kinetic parameter *v* of the reaction by the thermodynamic parameter $\\nu$ (\"nu\", from the Greek) for the binding isotherm. The other quantities involved remain analogous (*P* in place of *E*; *L* in place of *S*;*Kd* in place of *Km*; and *n* in place of *Vmax*).\n| Maintaining this similarity with the formalism of the *Michaelis-Menten equation*, the linearizations for the @eq-eqNu) follow in the same way, as well as non-linear adjustments to it, in the search for an *analytical solution* for the thermodynamic parameters *Kd* and *n*. Here is an example of a code snippet for the most common linearizations in the treatment of ligand-protein interaction data:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, figLinBind, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Main linearizations of the ligand-protein binding isotherm.\"}\n\n# Linearizations in bimolecular interactions\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 1e-6\nn <- 1\nv <- n * L / (Kd + L)\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # establishes plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| Deviations from linearity, on the other hand, are often used as diagnostics for models other than the *binding site homogeneity* model as above (*site heterogeneity*, *site creation*, *cooperativity*). The equations below describe these models, and consider *K*, *ligand-protein equilibrium association constant*, as the inverse of *Kd*, in order to make the expressions more readable:\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{Kd}\n$$ {#eq-eqKdK}\n\n| The *binding site heterogeneity* model assumes that there is one more site in the protein with distinct affinities for the ligand [@dahlquist197813]. Formally, this model can be exemplified for 2 sets of binding sites, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\frac{K1*[L]}{1+K1*[L]} + \\frac{K2*[L]}{1+K2*[L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqHeterSit}\n\n| The code snippet below exemplifies the model in `R`, as well as its main diagnostic linearizations.\n\n```{r,figHeterSit, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for heterogeneity of 2 sets of binding sites\"}\n\n# Binding site heterogeneity\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd1 <- 2e-6\nn1 <- 1\nKd2 <- 2e-8\nn2 <- 1\nv <- (n1 * L / (Kd1 + L)) + (n2 * L / (Kd2 + L))\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n1 + n2 - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graph window\n```\n\n| The *one-site creator* model [@parsons1978theoretical] establishes a positive cooperativity resulting from the production of new sites for the ligand in the protein. The following is the exemplified model and its resulting linearizations.\n\n```{r,figOneSitCreat, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for new site creation: *1-site creator*.\"}\n\n# New site creation under ligand interaction\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd1 <- 2e-6\nn1 <- 1\nKd2 <- 2e-5\nn2 <- 1\nnH <- 0.5\nv <- (n1 * L * 1 / Kd1) / (1 + 1 / Kd1 * L) +\n((n2 * 1 / Kd1 * 1 / Kd2 * L^2) / (1 + 1 / Kd1 * L) * (1 + 1 / Kd2 * L))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graph window\n```\n\n| The *cooperativity models (negative and positive)* follow a similar formalism described for oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the *Proteins* chapters. In *negative cooperativity* a second ligand molecule interacts with the protein with lower affinity:\n\n```{r,figCoopNeg, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for negative cooperativity of binding sites.\"}\n\n# Negative cooperativity in ligand-binding\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 2e-6\nn <- 1\nnH <- 0.5\nv <- (n * L^nH / (Kd + L^nH))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| In *positive cooperativity*, a second ligand molecule interacts with the protein with greater affinity than the first molecule [@parsons1978theoretical]:\n\n```{r,figCoopPos, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for positive cooperativity of binding sites.\"}\n\n# Positive cooperativity in ligand binding\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 2e-6\nn <- 1\nnH <- 1.5\nv <- (n * L^nH / (Kd + L^nH))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # establish plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphing window\n```\n\n| Note that the slope of the *Hill* plot is less than unity for *negative cooperativity* and greater than unity for *positive cooperativity*, and represents the same *nH* parameter seen in the *Proteins* chapter.\n| Although subject to criticism for its statistical inconsistency (dependent variable on both axes), the Scatchard representation has been favored for decades as a diagnostic for ligand-protein interaction models. Among its advantages is the ability to easily distinguish the positive cooperativity model (uphill) from the heterogeneity of binding sites (steep slope) or negative cooperativity (gentle slope).\n\n## Nonlinear Fitting in Ligand-Protein Interaction\n\n| Direct fits of the nonlinear equation of interaction models can also be performed as was done for the Michaelis-Menten equation in the *Enzymes* chapter. For example, one can simulate obtaining experimental *binding* data by the following excerpt, using the 'runif' (*random uniform*) command to generate a random sequence (as was done in the *Enzymes* chapter). To illustrate, see @fig-1SitBindSimul.\n\n```{r, label=\"fig-1SitBindSimul\"}\n# Ligand-Protein Interaction Isotherm\nn <- 1\nKd <- 10\nL <- 120\ni <- 3\nL <- seq(0, L, i)\nv <- (L * n) / (Kd + L) + rnorm(40, 0, 0.1)\nplot(L, v)\n```\n\n| Note that the 'rnorm' command adds a normal distribution error to the data. Another way to simulate these is given below by introducing the 'runif' random number generation command.\n\n```{r, 1sitBindSimul2, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = \"Simulated data for bimolecular interaction isotherm.\"}\n# Simulation of bimolecular interaction data (1 site)\n\n# Simulation of data\nset.seed(20160227) # sets seed for random number generation\nL <- seq(0, 50, 1)\nPL <- ((runif(1, 10, 20) * L) / (runif(1, 0, 10) + L)) + rnorm(51, 0, 1)\n# 1. runif(n,min,max); when without attributes, min=0 and max=1 are considered\n# 2. rnorm(no. points,mean,deviation) - random error of normal distribution\nplot(L, PL, xlab = \"L\", ylab = \"PL\")\n```\n\n| Now we need to use the 'nls' command for nonlinear fitting, superimposition of the theoretical curve, and statistical table of results:\n\n```{r, nlsBind}\n# Nonlinear fitting in ligand binding\nm <- nls(PL ~ n * L / (Kd + L), start = list(n = 1, Kd = 1))\n\n# Correlation coefficient\ncor(PL, predict(m)) # Pearson correlation coefficient\n\n# Data plot and simulation\nplot(L, PL)\nlines(L, predict(m), lty = 2, col = \"red\", lwd = 3)\nsummary(m)\n```\n\n## Graphics Systems in R\n\n| The last simulation curve obtained was from the standard library for manipulating graphics in the 'R' installation, **Graphics**. This is a broad set of functions also used by several other packages in the environment. However, there are several other libraries in 'R' for creating graphs, among which it is worth highlighting *Lattice*, also included in the standard installation, and *ggplot2*. Both systems generate results with better aesthetics and graphic flexibility than the standard *Graphics* library, and have different uses and semantics.\n| The *Lattice* system [@sarkar2008lattice] is based on the *Trellis* system for graphical representation of multivariate data. Its strength lies in the representation of data in panels containing subgroups and, although it has a less intuitive and sometimes more elaborate syntax than the *Graphics* package, it produces a superior graph with just a few keyboard clicks. In general, *Lattice* produces the graph within the algorithm itself, in a different way to the *Graphics* systems (successive lines of modification to the graph can be accumulated) or *ggplot2*.\n| On the other hand, the *ggplot2* library is based on the graphics grammar [@wickham2011ggplot2], and produces the graph using a single command line that combines overlapping layers, similar to image manipulation applications (e.g. *Inkscape*, *Gimp*, *Corel Draw*, *Photoshop*). This way, it is possible to change each item of the graph in its specific layers (theme, coordinates, facets, statistics, geometry, aesthetics, data). Exemplifying the graphical result of the simulation curve above *binding* for *Lattice* and *ggplot2*:\n\n```{r, 1sitBindSimulLattice}\n# The lattice and ggplot2 systems\n\n# Data simulation\n\nset.seed(20160227) # establishes seed for random number generation\nL <- seq(0, 50, 1)\nPL <- ((runif(1, 10, 20) * L) / (runif(1, 0, 10) + L)) + rnorm(51, 0, 1)\n# 1. runif(n,min,max); when without attributes, min=0 and max=1 are considered\n# 2. rnorm(no. points, mean, deviation) - random error of normal distribution\n\n# Graph production with Lattice system\nlibrary(lattice)\nxyplot(PL ~ L)\n\n# Graph production with ggplot2 system\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nqplot(L, PL)\n```\n\n| Since the perception of peculiarities of graphic systems is better revealed with more elaborate data, the following illustrations will use the 'Puromycin' data set, which is part of the 'R' 'datasets' library. The data show the speed of enzymatic reaction on a substrate in cells treated and not treated with puromycin.\n\n| The code below returns the plot, non-linear adjustment and results obtained with the standard *Graphics* library, and was extracted from the *dataset* documentation itself.\n\n```{r, puromycGraphics, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with `graphics`.\" }\nlibrary(datasets)\n\n# The base system `graphics`\n\nplot(rate ~ conc,\n data = Puromycin, las = 1,\n xlab = \"[S], mM\",\n ylab = \"v(count/min/min)\",\n pch = as.integer(Puromycin$state),\n col = as.integer(Puromycin$state),\n main = \"Adjustment Illustration With Graphics\"\n)\n\n## Adjustment of the Michaelis-Mentem equation\nfm1 <- nls(rate ~ Vm * conc / (K + conc),\n data = Puromycin,\n subset = state == \"treated\",\n start = c(Vm = 200, K = 0.05)\n)\nfm2 <- nls(rate ~ Vm * conc / (K + conc),\n data = Puromycin,\n subset = state == \"untreated\",\n start = c(Vm = 160, K = 0.05)\n)\nsummary(fm1)\nsummary(fm2)\n\n## Adding adjustment lines to the plot\nconc <- seq(0, 1.2, length.out = 101)\nlines(conc, predict(fm1, list(conc = conc)), lty = 1, col = 1)\nlines(conc, predict(fm2, list(conc = conc)), lty = 2, col = 2)\nlegend(0.8, 120, levels(Puromycin$state),\n col = 1:2, lty = 1:2, pch = 1:2\n)\n```\n\n| The *ggplot2* system, in turn, requires that the commands be listed in juxtaposed layers interspersed with the \"+\" sign, as follows:\n\n```{r, puromycGgplot2, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with ggplot2.\"}\n\n# Plot and analysis with ggplot2\nlibrary(datasets)\np <- ggplot(data = Puromycin, aes(conc, rate, color = state)) +\ngeom_point() +\ngeom_smooth(\nmethod = \"nls\",\nformula = y ~ Vm * x / (Km + x),\nmethod.args = list(start = list(Vm = 200, Km = 0.1)),\nse = FALSE\n) # expression that defines the plot\np # variable that displays the plot\n```\n\n| Note the fewer instructions in the *script* to produce the graph. In addition, and unlike *Graphics*, *ggplot2* allows you to add layers to the main command line, and display multivariate data in panels ('facet_grid' and 'facet_wrap' functions), without the need to use the 'mfrow' or 'mfcol' command seen in the chapter, as follows:\n\n```{r, puromycGgplot2Facet, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with ggplot2 - panels (faceting).\"}\np + facet_grid(rows = vars(state))\n```\n\n| *Lattice* also has a savings in instructions compared to *Graphics*. By disregarding the statistical adjustment, the groups can be displayed simply using the formula:\n\n$$\nxyplot(y \\sim x~|~ groups = z)\n$$ {#eq-eqTrellis}\n\n```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}\nlibrary(lattice)\nxyplot(rate ~ conc, data = Puromycin, groups = state)\n```\n\n| And for the representation of non-linear fits:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, puromicLattice}\n\n# A graph with dataset for lattice\n\nlibrary(nlme)\nn1 <- nlsList(rate ~ Vmax * conc / (Km + conc) | state,\ndata = Puromycin, start = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1))\nsummary(n1)\nxyplot(rate ~ conc,\ngroups = state, data =\nPuromycin\n) +\nlayer(panel.curve(Vmax[1] * x / (Km[1] + x), col = 1),\ndata = as.list(coef(n1))\n) +\nlayer(panel.curve(Vmax[2] * x / (Km[2] + x), col = 2),\ndata = as.list(coef(n1))\n)\n```\n\n| The *Lattice* library also allows panel presentation; Unlike *ggplot2*, however, the graph is generated algorithmically, without the need for overlapping commands:\n\n```{r, puromicLatticePan, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with Lattice - external fitting and panels.\"}\n\n# Nonlinear plotting and analysis with lattice\n\nlibrary(nlme) # package that allows nonlinear regression with subgroups\nnonlinLatt <- nlsList(rate ~ Vmax * conc /\n(Km + conc) | state,\nstart = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1), data = Puromycin)\nsummary(nonlinLatt)\nxyplot(rate + fitted(nonlinLatt) ~ conc | state,\ndata = Puromycin,\ntype = c(\"p\", \"l\"), distribute.type = TRUE, col.line = \"red\",\nylab = \"rate\"\n)\n```\n\n| Of the many differences between the *ggplot2* and *Lattice* packages, there is one that is worth highlighting. As seen above, *ggplot2* performs the non-linear fit within the graph generation command line, while *Lattice* allows it to be done offline. This is inherent to *ggplot2*, a library designed for producing graphs, and not for computational analysis. Thus, the algorithm that allows the non-linear fit by *ggplot2*, although it is the same 'nls' already used, does not express its results explicitly (although there are ways to \"fish\" for them using other packages).\n| In a way, although *Lattice* requires a less intuitive learning curve, it allows the use of previously obtained statistical results for inclusion in the plotting algorithm. This is advantageous when other statistical algorithms are desired for fit, as above, or even their flexibility, in addition to the 'nls' included in *ggplot2*. However, *Lattice* also allows you to include the adjustment line within the algorithm itself, as follows:\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, puromicLatticePanInterno, fig.cap= \"Plotting and analysis with Lattice - internal adjustment and panels.\" }\n\n# Nonlinear fitting in panels (Lattice)\n\nxyplot(rate ~ conc | state,\ndata = Puromycin,\npanel = function(x, y, ...) {\npanel.xyplot(x, y, ...)\nn3 <- nls(y ~ Vmax * x / (Km + x), data = Puromycin,\nstart = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1))\npanel.lines(seq(0.02, 1.1, 0.02),\npredict(n3, newdata = data.frame(x = seq(0.02, 1.1, 0.02))),\ncol.line = 2)\n},\nxlab = \"conc\", ylab = \"rate\"\n)\n```\n\n## Numerical Solution for the Equilibrium of Ligand-Protein Complexes\n\n| As seen in the *Amino Acids* chapter, sometimes a *numerical solution* can be used when the *analytical solution* does not converge, or when we are faced with a more complex equation. In this sense, the formation of complexes discussed in this subtitle can also be treated by a numerical solution.\n| Usually the treatment given to the numerical solution involves finding the roots of an equation or system of equations, that is:\n\n$$\nF(x) = 0\n$$ {#eq-eqFx}\n\n$$\nP+L \\rightleftarrows PL\n\\\\\nKd = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]}\n\\\\\nSo,\\ [PL]=\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq}\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n[Pt] = [P]+[PL] = [P]+\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\\\\\n[Lt] = [L]+[PL] = [L]+\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\n\\end{cases}\\\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq2}\n\n| Thus, we have a system of linear equations in the parameters (*[P]* free, *[L]* free, and complex *[PL]*) that can be solved by `R` in several ways, one of which is by the minimization function `rootSolve`:\n\n```{r}\n# Calculation of L, P, and PL in biomolecular interaction for 1 set of sites\n# with the same affinity\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nPt <- 1\nLt <- 10\nKd <- 4\n\n# Model\nmodel <- function(x) c(x[1] + (x[1] * x[2]) / Kd - Pt, x[2] +\n(x[1] * x[2]) / Kd - Lt, Pt - x[1] - x[3])\n# the model above must contain a list of equations whose equality is zero,\n# that is, f(x)=0\n(ss <- multiroot(model, c(1, 1, 1))) # command to execute\n# rootSolve (seeds for the algorithm)\n```\n\n| Thus, the resulting values ​​(*f.root*) when *[Lt]* = 10 are presented as *[P]* = 0.3, *[L]* = 9.3 and *[PL]* = 0.7.\n\n| Other numerical solutions allow greater control over the algorithm used, such as the `optim` function of `R` (solution search limits, use of vectors, for example). For this, the same situation above will be exemplified, although presenting a variation of the formalism that relates *P*, *L* and *PL* :\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n[PL] = [Pt]-[L]\\\\\n[PL] = [Lt]-[L]\\\\\n[P]*[L]=Kd*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\\\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq3}\n\n| In this way, a quadratic relation can be constructed involving the three unknowns:\n\n$$\n([Pt]-[L]-[PL])^2 + ([Lt]-[L]-[PL])^2 + ([P]*[L]-Kd*[PL])^2\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq4}\n\n| Applying the `optim` minimization algorithm of `R`:\n\n```{r}\n# Calculation of L, P, PL in interaction for 1 site\n\nmodel2 <- function(x, Pt, Lt, K) {\nL <- x[1]\nP <- x[2]\nPL <- x[3]\n(Pt - P - PL)^2 + (Lt - L - PL)^2 + (P * L - Kd * PL)^2\n} # function declaration\nPt <- 1\nLt <- 10\nKd <- 4 # function parameters\nsol2num <- optim(c(0.5, 1, .5), model2, method = \"L-BFGS-B\",\nlower = c(0, 0, 0), upper = c(Lt, Pt, Pt), Pt = Pt, Lt = Lt)\n# BFGS method allows bounds (lower, upper)\nsol2num$par # LF, PF, PL calculated\n```\n\n| Note that these are the same results as before, although with greater control over the solution. Now we can use this minimization to create a vector of solutions for the three quantities, as follows:\n\n```{r}\n# Function declaration\nbind1 <- function(x, Pt, Lt, Kd) {\nL <- x[1]\nP <- x[2]\nPL <- x[3]\n(Pt - P - PL)^2 + (Lt - L - PL)^2 + (P * L - Kd * PL)^2\n}\n\n# Function parameters\nPt <- 1\nLt <- c(5, 10, 20)\nKd <- 4\n\n# Minimization (parameters for the above function to return zero)\ny <- function(i) {\noptim(c(1, 1, 1), bind1,\nmethod =\n\"L-BFGS-B\", lower = c(0, 0, 0), upper = c(\nLt[i], Pt,\n Pt\n ), Lt = Lt[i], Pt = Pt, Kd = Kd\n )\n}\n\n# Results in array\nypar <- function(i) y(i)$par\nyp <- matrix(\n nrow = length(Lt), ncol = 2 + length(Kd),\n byrow = T\n)\nfor (i in 1:length(Lt)) yp[i, ] <- y(i)$par\ncolnames(yp) <- c(\"L\", \"P\", \"PL\")\nrownames(yp) <- c(\"5\", \"10\", \"20\")\nyp\n```\n\n\n## Ligand-Protein Interaction Kinetics and Numerical Solution\n\n| Under the same principle of the numerical solution presented in the previous item for the equilibrium of the ligand-protein interaction, `R` allows a solution of the same nature for the kinetics of the formation of the complexes, that is, the levels of *P*, *L* and *PL* observed in time. In this case, other relations can be developed from @eq-diagPL. Assuming that in equilibrium the kinetic rates of *k$_{on}$* and *k$_{off}$* are equal (*steady-state*), one can relate some differential equations for the *association*, as well as for the *dissociation* of the complexes:\n\n$$\nFor \\, a\\, association:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = k_{on}*[L]*[P]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin}\n\n$$\nFor \\, a\\, dissociation:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = -k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{off}*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin2}\n\n| Thus, the resulting overall rates for each quantity (net rate) will involve the sum of the association and dissociation rates of each:\n\n$$\nNet \\, rates:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = k_{on}*[L]*[P]-k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]+k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]+k_{off}*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin3}\n\n| The solution to this final system of differential equations (net rates) involves solving for the variation of each quantity (*$\\Delta$x*) in a given time interval (*$\\Delta$t*), such that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta x=f(x)*\\Delta t\n$$ {#eq-eqDiff}\n\n| To do this, it is necessary to use an `R` library that allows the solution of a system of differential equations. Among the many solutions (`odeintr`, `pracma`, `rODE`), the use of the `deSolve` library, which uses a function for system integration by the *Runge-Kutta 4th-order algorithm, is recommended. order*:\n\n```{r,fig.cap=\"Free ligand and protein (L and P) as well as PL complex contents plotted over time according to the 4th order Runge-Kutta method for solving differential equations.\"}\n# Kinetics of ligand-protein interactions for 1 set of sites\nlibrary(deSolve)\n\n# Experimental conditions\ntime <- seq(0, 100) # time interval\nparms <- c(kon = 0.02, koff = 0.001) # steady state parameters\n# of the interaction (uM^-1*s^-1 and s^-1, respectively)\nval.inic <- c(L = 0.8, P = 1, PL = 0) # initial values, uM\n\n# System integration by Runge-Kutta of 4th order\nsolNumKin <- function(t, x, parms) {\n# parameter list definition\nL <- x[1] # ligand\nP <- x[2] # protein\nPL <- x[3] # complex\n\nwith(as.list(parms), {\n# differential equation list definition\ndL <- -kon * L * P + koff * PL\ndP <- -kon * L * P + koff * PL\ndPL <- kon * L * P - koff * PL\nres <- c(dL, dP, dPL)\nlist(res)\n})\n}\n\nsol.rk4 <- as.data.frame(rk4(\nval.inic, time, solNumKin,\nparms\n)) # routine for Runge-Kutta 4a. order\n\n# Chart\nplot(sol.rk4$time, sol.rk4$L, type = \"l\", xlab = \"time\",\n ylab = \"[compound], uM\")\nlegend(\"topright\", c(\"L\", \"P\", \"PL\"),\n text.col = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"blue\"), bty = \"n\", lty = c(1, 2, 3))\nlines(sol.rk4$time, sol.rk4$P, type = \"l\", lty = 2, col = 2, lwd = 1.5)\nlines(sol.rk4$time, sol.rk4$PL, type = \"l\", lty = 3, col = 3, lwd = 1.5)\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Ligand-biopolymer interaction {#Binding}\n\n| When mentioning interaction between biomolecules, one usually refers to adsorptive processes involving a biopolymer (protein, nucleic acid, glycan) and a low molecular weight ligand, although the formalism also applies with some restriction to interactions between biopolymers, and even whole cells.\n| The most common formalism for biomolecular interaction is that which involves the formation of an adsorptive complex between a protein and a ligand (*ligand binding*), exemplified for ions (Ca$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$, etc.), drugs and candidates, natural products, and antigens, among others.\n| Simple questions about *ligand-protein interaction* can elucidate several characteristics of the formation of such complexes, such as:\n\n1. How much protein/ligand is present?\n2. How much of the complex is formed?\n3. How fast does the complex associate/dissociate?\n4. What are the mechanisms involved?\n\n| In general, the ligand-protein interaction can be represented as follows:\n\n$$\nP+L \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k_{on}}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{k_{off}} \\end{array} PL\n$$ {#eq-diagPL}\n\nWhere *P* represents the free protein content, *L* the free ligand, and *PL* the formed complex. The reaction rates are defined for the formation (*k$_{on}$*; M$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$) and dissociation (*k$_{off}$*; s$^{-1}$) of the complex.\n\n| Thus, the equation for the *interaction isotherm* of the ligand with the protein is deduced as follows:\n\n$$\nKd=\\frac{[P]*[L]}{[P]+[L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqPL}\n\nWhere *Kd* represents the *equilibrium dissociation constant* for the formed *PL* complex, as conditioned on the formation/dissociation equilibrium of the complex (*v$_{assoc}$ = v$_{dissoc}$*), and also defined as:\n\n$$\nKd=\\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}\n$$ {#eq-eqKd}\n\n| From @eq-eqPL one can easily deduce the final expression for the interaction of a ligand to a set of sites of the same affinity on the protein:\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\frac{n * [L]}{Kd + [L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqNu}\n\n## Interaction Models and Linear Representations\n| Note that @eq-eqNu practically repeats the formalism already seen with the formation of the activated enzyme-substrate complex from the *Enzymes* chapter, as well as its resulting representation as a quadratic hyperbola. In fact, it essentially replaces the kinetic parameter *v* of the reaction by the thermodynamic parameter $\\nu$ (\"nu\", from the Greek) for the binding isotherm. The other quantities involved remain analogous (*P* in place of *E*; *L* in place of *S*;*Kd* in place of *Km*; and *n* in place of *Vmax*).\n| Maintaining this similarity with the formalism of the *Michaelis-Menten equation*, the linearizations for the @eq-eqNu) follow in the same way, as well as non-linear adjustments to it, in the search for an *analytical solution* for the thermodynamic parameters *Kd* and *n*. Here is an example of a code snippet for the most common linearizations in the treatment of ligand-protein interaction data:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, figLinBind, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Main linearizations of the ligand-protein binding isotherm.\"}\n\n# Linearizations in bimolecular interactions\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 1e-6\nn <- 1\nv <- n * L / (Kd + L)\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # establishes plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| Deviations from linearity, on the other hand, are often used as diagnostics for models other than the *binding site homogeneity* model as above (*site heterogeneity*, *site creation*, *cooperativity*). The equations below describe these models, and consider *K*, *ligand-protein equilibrium association constant*, as the inverse of *Kd*, in order to make the expressions more readable:\n\n$$\nK = \\frac{1}{Kd}\n$$ {#eq-eqKdK}\n\n| The *binding site heterogeneity* model assumes that there is one more site in the protein with distinct affinities for the ligand [@dahlquist197813]. Formally, this model can be exemplified for 2 sets of binding sites, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\nu=\\frac{K1*[L]}{1+K1*[L]} + \\frac{K2*[L]}{1+K2*[L]}\n$$ {#eq-eqHeterSit}\n\n| The code snippet below exemplifies the model in `R`, as well as its main diagnostic linearizations.\n\n```{r,figHeterSit, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for heterogeneity of 2 sets of binding sites\"}\n\n# Binding site heterogeneity\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd1 <- 2e-6\nn1 <- 1\nKd2 <- 2e-8\nn2 <- 1\nv <- (n1 * L / (Kd1 + L)) + (n2 * L / (Kd2 + L))\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n1 + n2 - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graph window\n```\n\n| The *one-site creator* model [@parsons1978theoretical] establishes a positive cooperativity resulting from the production of new sites for the ligand in the protein. The following is the exemplified model and its resulting linearizations.\n\n```{r,figOneSitCreat, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for new site creation: *1-site creator*.\"}\n\n# New site creation under ligand interaction\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd1 <- 2e-6\nn1 <- 1\nKd2 <- 2e-5\nn2 <- 1\nnH <- 0.5\nv <- (n1 * L * 1 / Kd1) / (1 + 1 / Kd1 * L) +\n((n2 * 1 / Kd1 * 1 / Kd2 * L^2) / (1 + 1 / Kd1 * L) * (1 + 1 / Kd2 * L))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graph window\n```\n\n| The *cooperativity models (negative and positive)* follow a similar formalism described for oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the *Proteins* chapters. In *negative cooperativity* a second ligand molecule interacts with the protein with lower affinity:\n\n```{r,figCoopNeg, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for negative cooperativity of binding sites.\"}\n\n# Negative cooperativity in ligand-binding\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 2e-6\nn <- 1\nnH <- 0.5\nv <- (n * L^nH / (Kd + L^nH))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # set plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| In *positive cooperativity*, a second ligand molecule interacts with the protein with greater affinity than the first molecule [@parsons1978theoretical]:\n\n```{r,figCoopPos, fig.cap=\"Model and linearizations for positive cooperativity of binding sites.\"}\n\n# Positive cooperativity in ligand binding\n\nL <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20) * 1e-6\nKd <- 2e-6\nn <- 1\nnH <- 1.5\nv <- (n * L^nH / (Kd + L^nH))\npar(mfrow = c(2, 3)) # establish plot area for 6 graphs\nplot(L, v, type = \"o\", main = \"Direct\")\nplot(log(L), v, type = \"o\", main = \"Langmuir\")\nplot(1 / L, 1 / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Klotz\")\nplot(v, v / L, type = \"o\", main = \"Scatchard\")\nplot(L, L / v, type = \"o\", main = \"Woolf\")\nplot(log10(L), log10(v / (n - v)), type = \"o\", main = \"Hill\")\n# n1+n2=ntot no Hill\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1)) # return to normal graphing window\n```\n\n| Note that the slope of the *Hill* plot is less than unity for *negative cooperativity* and greater than unity for *positive cooperativity*, and represents the same *nH* parameter seen in the *Proteins* chapter.\n| Although subject to criticism for its statistical inconsistency (dependent variable on both axes), the Scatchard representation has been favored for decades as a diagnostic for ligand-protein interaction models. Among its advantages is the ability to easily distinguish the positive cooperativity model (uphill) from the heterogeneity of binding sites (steep slope) or negative cooperativity (gentle slope).\n\n## Nonlinear Fitting in Ligand-Protein Interaction\n\n| Direct fits of the nonlinear equation of interaction models can also be performed as was done for the Michaelis-Menten equation in the *Enzymes* chapter. For example, one can simulate obtaining experimental *binding* data by the following excerpt, using the 'runif' (*random uniform*) command to generate a random sequence (as was done in the *Enzymes* chapter). To illustrate, see @fig-1SitBindSimul.\n\n```{r, label=\"fig-1SitBindSimul\"}\n# Ligand-Protein Interaction Isotherm\nn <- 1\nKd <- 10\nL <- 120\ni <- 3\nL <- seq(0, L, i)\nv <- (L * n) / (Kd + L) + rnorm(40, 0, 0.1)\nplot(L, v)\n```\n\n| Note that the 'rnorm' command adds a normal distribution error to the data. Another way to simulate these is given below by introducing the 'runif' random number generation command.\n\n```{r, 1sitBindSimul2, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = \"Simulated data for bimolecular interaction isotherm.\"}\n# Simulation of bimolecular interaction data (1 site)\n\n# Simulation of data\nset.seed(20160227) # sets seed for random number generation\nL <- seq(0, 50, 1)\nPL <- ((runif(1, 10, 20) * L) / (runif(1, 0, 10) + L)) + rnorm(51, 0, 1)\n# 1. runif(n,min,max); when without attributes, min=0 and max=1 are considered\n# 2. rnorm(no. points,mean,deviation) - random error of normal distribution\nplot(L, PL, xlab = \"L\", ylab = \"PL\")\n```\n\n| Now we need to use the 'nls' command for nonlinear fitting, superimposition of the theoretical curve, and statistical table of results:\n\n```{r, nlsBind}\n# Nonlinear fitting in ligand binding\nm <- nls(PL ~ n * L / (Kd + L), start = list(n = 1, Kd = 1))\n\n# Correlation coefficient\ncor(PL, predict(m)) # Pearson correlation coefficient\n\n# Data plot and simulation\nplot(L, PL)\nlines(L, predict(m), lty = 2, col = \"red\", lwd = 3)\nsummary(m)\n```\n\n## Graphics Systems in R\n\n| The last simulation curve obtained was from the standard library for manipulating graphics in the 'R' installation, **Graphics**. This is a broad set of functions also used by several other packages in the environment. However, there are several other libraries in 'R' for creating graphs, among which it is worth highlighting *Lattice*, also included in the standard installation, and *ggplot2*. Both systems generate results with better aesthetics and graphic flexibility than the standard *Graphics* library, and have different uses and semantics.\n| The *Lattice* system [@sarkar2008lattice] is based on the *Trellis* system for graphical representation of multivariate data. Its strength lies in the representation of data in panels containing subgroups and, although it has a less intuitive and sometimes more elaborate syntax than the *Graphics* package, it produces a superior graph with just a few keyboard clicks. In general, *Lattice* produces the graph within the algorithm itself, in a different way to the *Graphics* systems (successive lines of modification to the graph can be accumulated) or *ggplot2*.\n| On the other hand, the *ggplot2* library is based on the graphics grammar [@wickham2011ggplot2], and produces the graph using a single command line that combines overlapping layers, similar to image manipulation applications (e.g. *Inkscape*, *Gimp*, *Corel Draw*, *Photoshop*). This way, it is possible to change each item of the graph in its specific layers (theme, coordinates, facets, statistics, geometry, aesthetics, data). Exemplifying the graphical result of the simulation curve above *binding* for *Lattice* and *ggplot2*:\n\n```{r, 1sitBindSimulLattice}\n# The lattice and ggplot2 systems\n\n# Data simulation\n\nset.seed(20160227) # establishes seed for random number generation\nL <- seq(0, 50, 1)\nPL <- ((runif(1, 10, 20) * L) / (runif(1, 0, 10) + L)) + rnorm(51, 0, 1)\n# 1. runif(n,min,max); when without attributes, min=0 and max=1 are considered\n# 2. rnorm(no. points, mean, deviation) - random error of normal distribution\n\n# Graph production with Lattice system\nlibrary(lattice)\nxyplot(PL ~ L)\n\n# Graph production with ggplot2 system\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nqplot(L, PL)\n```\n\n| Since the perception of peculiarities of graphic systems is better revealed with more elaborate data, the following illustrations will use the 'Puromycin' data set, which is part of the 'R' 'datasets' library. The data show the speed of enzymatic reaction on a substrate in cells treated and not treated with puromycin.\n\n| The code below returns the plot, non-linear adjustment and results obtained with the standard *Graphics* library, and was extracted from the *dataset* documentation itself.\n\n```{r, puromycGraphics, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with `graphics`.\" }\nlibrary(datasets)\n\n# The base system `graphics`\n\nplot(rate ~ conc,\n data = Puromycin, las = 1,\n xlab = \"[S], mM\",\n ylab = \"v(count/min/min)\",\n pch = as.integer(Puromycin$state),\n col = as.integer(Puromycin$state),\n main = \"Adjustment Illustration With Graphics\"\n)\n\n## Adjustment of the Michaelis-Mentem equation\nfm1 <- nls(rate ~ Vm * conc / (K + conc),\n data = Puromycin,\n subset = state == \"treated\",\n start = c(Vm = 200, K = 0.05)\n)\nfm2 <- nls(rate ~ Vm * conc / (K + conc),\n data = Puromycin,\n subset = state == \"untreated\",\n start = c(Vm = 160, K = 0.05)\n)\nsummary(fm1)\nsummary(fm2)\n\n## Adding adjustment lines to the plot\nconc <- seq(0, 1.2, length.out = 101)\nlines(conc, predict(fm1, list(conc = conc)), lty = 1, col = 1)\nlines(conc, predict(fm2, list(conc = conc)), lty = 2, col = 2)\nlegend(0.8, 120, levels(Puromycin$state),\n col = 1:2, lty = 1:2, pch = 1:2\n)\n```\n\n| The *ggplot2* system, in turn, requires that the commands be listed in juxtaposed layers interspersed with the \"+\" sign, as follows:\n\n```{r, puromycGgplot2, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with ggplot2.\"}\n\n# Plot and analysis with ggplot2\nlibrary(datasets)\np <- ggplot(data = Puromycin, aes(conc, rate, color = state)) +\ngeom_point() +\ngeom_smooth(\nmethod = \"nls\",\nformula = y ~ Vm * x / (Km + x),\nmethod.args = list(start = list(Vm = 200, Km = 0.1)),\nse = FALSE\n) # expression that defines the plot\np # variable that displays the plot\n```\n\n| Note the fewer instructions in the *script* to produce the graph. In addition, and unlike *Graphics*, *ggplot2* allows you to add layers to the main command line, and display multivariate data in panels ('facet_grid' and 'facet_wrap' functions), without the need to use the 'mfrow' or 'mfcol' command seen in the chapter, as follows:\n\n```{r, puromycGgplot2Facet, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with ggplot2 - panels (faceting).\"}\np + facet_grid(rows = vars(state))\n```\n\n| *Lattice* also has a savings in instructions compared to *Graphics*. By disregarding the statistical adjustment, the groups can be displayed simply using the formula:\n\n$$\nxyplot(y \\sim x~|~ groups = z)\n$$ {#eq-eqTrellis}\n\n```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}\nlibrary(lattice)\nxyplot(rate ~ conc, data = Puromycin, groups = state)\n```\n\n| And for the representation of non-linear fits:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, puromicLattice}\n\n# A graph with dataset for lattice\n\nlibrary(nlme)\nn1 <- nlsList(rate ~ Vmax * conc / (Km + conc) | state,\ndata = Puromycin, start = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1))\nsummary(n1)\nxyplot(rate ~ conc,\ngroups = state, data =\nPuromycin\n) +\nlayer(panel.curve(Vmax[1] * x / (Km[1] + x), col = 1),\ndata = as.list(coef(n1))\n) +\nlayer(panel.curve(Vmax[2] * x / (Km[2] + x), col = 2),\ndata = as.list(coef(n1))\n)\n```\n\n| The *Lattice* library also allows panel presentation; Unlike *ggplot2*, however, the graph is generated algorithmically, without the need for overlapping commands:\n\n```{r, puromicLatticePan, fig.cap=\"Plotting and analysis with Lattice - external fitting and panels.\"}\n\n# Nonlinear plotting and analysis with lattice\n\nlibrary(nlme) # package that allows nonlinear regression with subgroups\nnonlinLatt <- nlsList(rate ~ Vmax * conc /\n(Km + conc) | state,\nstart = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1), data = Puromycin)\nsummary(nonlinLatt)\nxyplot(rate + fitted(nonlinLatt) ~ conc | state,\ndata = Puromycin,\ntype = c(\"p\", \"l\"), distribute.type = TRUE, col.line = \"red\",\nylab = \"rate\"\n)\n```\n\n| Of the many differences between the *ggplot2* and *Lattice* packages, there is one that is worth highlighting. As seen above, *ggplot2* performs the non-linear fit within the graph generation command line, while *Lattice* allows it to be done offline. This is inherent to *ggplot2*, a library designed for producing graphs, and not for computational analysis. Thus, the algorithm that allows the non-linear fit by *ggplot2*, although it is the same 'nls' already used, does not express its results explicitly (although there are ways to \"fish\" for them using other packages).\n| In a way, although *Lattice* requires a less intuitive learning curve, it allows the use of previously obtained statistical results for inclusion in the plotting algorithm. This is advantageous when other statistical algorithms are desired for fit, as above, or even their flexibility, in addition to the 'nls' included in *ggplot2*. However, *Lattice* also allows you to include the adjustment line within the algorithm itself, as follows:\n\n```{r, warning=FALSE, puromicLatticePanInterno, fig.cap= \"Plotting and analysis with Lattice - internal adjustment and panels.\" }\n\n# Nonlinear fitting in panels (Lattice)\n\nxyplot(rate ~ conc | state,\ndata = Puromycin,\npanel = function(x, y, ...) {\npanel.xyplot(x, y, ...)\nn3 <- nls(y ~ Vmax * x / (Km + x), data = Puromycin,\nstart = list(Vmax = 200, Km = 0.1))\npanel.lines(seq(0.02, 1.1, 0.02),\npredict(n3, newdata = data.frame(x = seq(0.02, 1.1, 0.02))),\ncol.line = 2)\n},\nxlab = \"conc\", ylab = \"rate\"\n)\n```\n\n## Numerical Solution for the Equilibrium of Ligand-Protein Complexes\n\n| As seen in the *Amino Acids* chapter, sometimes a *numerical solution* can be used when the *analytical solution* does not converge, or when we are faced with a more complex equation. In this sense, the formation of complexes discussed in this subtitle can also be treated by a numerical solution.\n| Usually the treatment given to the numerical solution involves finding the roots of an equation or system of equations, that is:\n\n$$\nF(x) = 0\n$$ {#eq-eqFx}\n\n$$\nP+L \\rightleftarrows PL\n\\\\\nKd = \\frac{[P][L]}{[PL]}\n\\\\\nSo,\\ [PL]=\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq}\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n[Pt] = [P]+[PL] = [P]+\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\\\\\n[Lt] = [L]+[PL] = [L]+\\frac{[P][L]}{Kd}\n\\end{cases}\\\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq2}\n\n| Thus, we have a system of linear equations in the parameters (*[P]* free, *[L]* free, and complex *[PL]*) that can be solved by `R` in several ways, one of which is by the minimization function `rootSolve`:\n\n```{r}\n# Calculation of L, P, and PL in biomolecular interaction for 1 set of sites\n# with the same affinity\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nPt <- 1\nLt <- 10\nKd <- 4\n\n# Model\nmodel <- function(x) c(x[1] + (x[1] * x[2]) / Kd - Pt, x[2] +\n(x[1] * x[2]) / Kd - Lt, Pt - x[1] - x[3])\n# the model above must contain a list of equations whose equality is zero,\n# that is, f(x)=0\n(ss <- multiroot(model, c(1, 1, 1))) # command to execute\n# rootSolve (seeds for the algorithm)\n```\n\n| Thus, the resulting values ​​(*f.root*) when *[Lt]* = 10 are presented as *[P]* = 0.3, *[L]* = 9.3 and *[PL]* = 0.7.\n\n| Other numerical solutions allow greater control over the algorithm used, such as the `optim` function of `R` (solution search limits, use of vectors, for example). For this, the same situation above will be exemplified, although presenting a variation of the formalism that relates *P*, *L* and *PL* :\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n[PL] = [Pt]-[L]\\\\\n[PL] = [Lt]-[L]\\\\\n[P]*[L]=Kd*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\\\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq3}\n\n| In this way, a quadratic relation can be constructed involving the three unknowns:\n\n$$\n([Pt]-[L]-[PL])^2 + ([Lt]-[L]-[PL])^2 + ([P]*[L]-Kd*[PL])^2\n$$ {#eq-solNumEq4}\n\n| Applying the `optim` minimization algorithm of `R`:\n\n```{r}\n# Calculation of L, P, PL in interaction for 1 site\n\nmodel2 <- function(x, Pt, Lt, K) {\nL <- x[1]\nP <- x[2]\nPL <- x[3]\n(Pt - P - PL)^2 + (Lt - L - PL)^2 + (P * L - Kd * PL)^2\n} # function declaration\nPt <- 1\nLt <- 10\nKd <- 4 # function parameters\nsol2num <- optim(c(0.5, 1, .5), model2, method = \"L-BFGS-B\",\nlower = c(0, 0, 0), upper = c(Lt, Pt, Pt), Pt = Pt, Lt = Lt)\n# BFGS method allows bounds (lower, upper)\nsol2num$par # LF, PF, PL calculated\n```\n\n| Note that these are the same results as before, although with greater control over the solution. Now we can use this minimization to create a vector of solutions for the three quantities, as follows:\n\n```{r}\n# Function declaration\nbind1 <- function(x, Pt, Lt, Kd) {\nL <- x[1]\nP <- x[2]\nPL <- x[3]\n(Pt - P - PL)^2 + (Lt - L - PL)^2 + (P * L - Kd * PL)^2\n}\n\n# Function parameters\nPt <- 1\nLt <- c(5, 10, 20)\nKd <- 4\n\n# Minimization (parameters for the above function to return zero)\ny <- function(i) {\noptim(c(1, 1, 1), bind1,\nmethod =\n\"L-BFGS-B\", lower = c(0, 0, 0), upper = c(\nLt[i], Pt,\n Pt\n ), Lt = Lt[i], Pt = Pt, Kd = Kd\n )\n}\n\n# Results in array\nypar <- function(i) y(i)$par\nyp <- matrix(\n nrow = length(Lt), ncol = 2 + length(Kd),\n byrow = T\n)\nfor (i in 1:length(Lt)) yp[i, ] <- y(i)$par\ncolnames(yp) <- c(\"L\", \"P\", \"PL\")\nrownames(yp) <- c(\"5\", \"10\", \"20\")\nyp\n```\n\n\n## Ligand-Protein Interaction Kinetics and Numerical Solution\n\n| Under the same principle of the numerical solution presented in the previous item for the equilibrium of the ligand-protein interaction, `R` allows a solution of the same nature for the kinetics of the formation of the complexes, that is, the levels of *P*, *L* and *PL* observed in time. In this case, other relations can be developed from @eq-diagPL. Assuming that in equilibrium the kinetic rates of *k$_{on}$* and *k$_{off}$* are equal (*steady-state*), one can relate some differential equations for the *association*, as well as for the *dissociation* of the complexes:\n\n$$\nFor \\, a\\, association:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = k_{on}*[L]*[P]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin}\n\n$$\nFor \\, a\\, dissociation:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = -k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{off}*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin2}\n\n| Thus, the resulting overall rates for each quantity (net rate) will involve the sum of the association and dissociation rates of each:\n\n$$\nNet \\, rates:\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{d[PL]}{dt} = k_{on}*[L]*[P]-k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]+k_{off}*[PL]\\\\\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = -k_{on}*[L]*[P]+k_{off}*[PL]\n\\end{cases}\n$$ {#eq-solNumKin3}\n\n| The solution to this final system of differential equations (net rates) involves solving for the variation of each quantity (*$\\Delta$x*) in a given time interval (*$\\Delta$t*), such that:\n\n$$\n\\Delta x=f(x)*\\Delta t\n$$ {#eq-eqDiff}\n\n| To do this, it is necessary to use an `R` library that allows the solution of a system of differential equations. Among the many solutions (`odeintr`, `pracma`, `rODE`), the use of the `deSolve` library, which uses a function for system integration by the *Runge-Kutta 4th-order algorithm, is recommended.
