Using an acetobacterial medium as an example, we can illustrate the acetate buffer, with a pKa value of 4.75. To do this, the `curve` function is used with its arguments (`args`), as follows:\n\n```{r, echo = TRUE }\n# Arguments for a function\nargs(curve)\n```\n\nOr, in a simpler way:\n\n```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.cap=\"Relationship between pH (abscissa) and acid fraction (ordinate) for the conjugate pair acetic acid/acetate ion.\"}\n# Titration curve for the acetate/acetic acid system\npKa = 4.75\ncurve((1/(1+10^(x-pKa))),0.14)\n```\n\n| You can also do the opposite, creating a graph with the fraction *fb*:\n\n```{r , echo=TRUE, fig.cap=\"Relationship between pH (abscissa) and basic fraction (ordinate) for the conjugate pair acetic acid/acetate ion.\"}\n# Titration curve for the acetate/acetic acid system\npKa = 4.75\ncurve(((10^(x-pKa))/(1+10^(x-pKa))),0.14)\n```\n\n## Bicarbonate system\n\n| With the above procedure, it is also possible to simulate the titration curve for the blood buffer bicarbonate system based on the pKa values ​​of the conjugate acid-base pair, simply by adding the expressions in the equation \\eqref{eq-HH-fa}, such that:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfa = \\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pKa1)}}+ \\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pKa2)}}\n\\label{HHbic}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTherefore,\n\n```{r, label=\"fig-titAcet\", fig.cap=\"Relationship between pH (abscissa) and acid fraction (ordinate) for the conjugate carbonic acid/bicarbonate ion pair.\"}\n\npKa1 = 6.37\npKa2 = 10.20\ncurve((1/(1+10^(x-pKa1)))+1/(1+10^(x-pKa2)),0,14)\n```\n\n| The @fig-titAcet graph can be stored in formats, using, for example, the `dev.copy` command:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ndev.copy(pdf,\"titBicarb.pdf\",width=6, height=3) # alternatively, bmp,\n# jpeg, tiff, svg, png\n```\n\n| And of course, starting from the arguments of the `curve` function above, and the flexibility that the internal package *Graphics* of R allows, one can elaborate a more complex curve, as follows:\n\n```{r, echo = TRUE, fig.cap=\"Variation of pH with reduction of the acid fraction in a bicarbonate system.\"}\npKa1 = 6.37\npKa2 = 10.20\ncurve((1/(1+10^(x-pKa1)))+1/(1+10^(x-pKa2)),0,14,\nxlab=\"pH\",ylab=\"fa\",\nmain=\"Carbonic Acid Titration, H2CO3/HCO3-\",\ntype=\"o\", n=50,lwd=2,lty=\"dotted\",\npch=3,col=\"blue\",cex=1.2) # titration graph\n\ntext(4.7,1.3,\"pKa = 6.37\") # inserting text into the graph\ntext(9,0.3,\"pKa = 10.20\")\nabline(0.5,0, lty=\"dotted\") # dotted line at specific intercept\n# and slope\nabline(1.5,0, lty=\"dotted\")\n\n```\n\n| For illustration purposes, it is possible to \"recover\" the physiological *pKa* value above, that is, *pKa1*, using the `locator()` command. Since it is just one point on the graph, simply type the code `locator(1)` and left-click on the point on the curve corresponding to the fraction of 0.5 for *fa*.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlocator(1) # for more points on the graph, simply increase the value in parentheses\n```\n\n| Note that as the *pH* value approaches that of *pKa*, the increasing variation in *fa* seems to affect the variation in pH less and less. This is the \"soul\" of the buffer system, which allows organisms to resist pH variations as long as they are close to the corresponding *pKa* value (bicarbonate, phosphate, proteins).\n\n| While the bicarbonate system has two pKa values ​​[^buffers-1] , one of which is in the extracellular physiological buffering range, the phosphate system that acts intracellularly has three pKa values, although it also acts in only one physiological range.\n\n[^buffers-1]: Note: the pKa value of the bicarbonate system is 6.8 when considering $CO_2$ as a source of carbonic acid $H_2CO_3$ in its reaction with $H_2O$, for example, for determining arterial parameters and from hospital analyzer ($CO_2$, $HCO_3^-$, $O_2$).\n\n## Phosphate system\n\n| In the same way as simulated for the bicarbonate system, we can develop a titration curve for the phosphate buffering system, this time considering its three pKa values ​​corresponding to each dissociation of triprotic acid. As before, the expression that defines the fraction *fa* should be taken as an algebraic sum, as follows:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfa = \\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pKa1)}}+ \\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pK2)}}+\\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pKa3)}}\n\\label{eq-HHfosf}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn *R* this can be done as follows: \\eqref{eq-HHfosf}\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=\"Titration curve in a phosphate system buffering.\"}\npKa1=2.2\npKa2=7.2\npKa3=12.7\n\ncurve((1/(1+10^(x-pKa1)))+\n(1/(1+10^(x-pKa2)))+\n(1/(1+10^(x-pKa3))),\nxlim=c(1,14),\nxlab=\"pH\",ylab=\"fa\",\nmain=\"Phosphate buffer titration\",\nsub = \" Dotted lines cross pKa values\"\n)\nabline(v=c(2.2,7.2,12.7),col=c(\"blue\",\"red\",\"green\"),lty=\"dotted\") # adding\n# vertical lines marking pKa values\ntext(1.6,2.5,\"pKa1\")\ntext(6.5,1.5,\"pKa2\")\ntext(11.8,0.5,\"pKa3\")\n```\n\n### General system titration with R programming\n\n| As illustrated in the supply of arguments to the *args* function, 'R' is an object-oriented programming language, and its commands are structured as *functions*. Thus, it is possible to create a function in 'R' to operationalize or automate any computational work.\n| A function can be created basically by the following instruction:\n\n```{r func.general, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}\nfunction.X <- function( arg1, arg2, arg3 )\n{\nexecution commands\nreturn(function object)\n}\n```\n\n| As an example, a function can be created to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius (C) to absolute temperature (K), as follows:\n\n```{r, echo =TRUE}\n# Function to convert degrees Celsius to Kelvin\nCtoK <- function (tC) {\ntK <-tC + 273.15\nreturn(tK)\n}\n```\n\n| To execute this *CtoK* function, simply:\n\n```{r, echo =TRUE}\n# Executing CtoK:\nCtoK (37)\n```\n\n| With this in mind, we can also create a function that helps in the elaboration of titration curves, as above. These operations can be automated not only for the phosphate buffer, but for any compound under dissociation in aqueous medium, regardless of the number of protons involved. To do this, it is necessary to:\n\n1. Define a *function* of *R* that contains the parameters and the desired operation.\n\n2. Include a *loop* structure in the function that allows the operation to be repeated until the compound's proton count is exhausted.\n\n3. Define a vector of *R* containing the compound's pKa values.\n\n4. Define the *curve* expression that enables the simulation.\n\nBelow is a code model that allows the simulation for the phosphate buffer.\n\n```{r, echo =TRUE, fig.cap=\"Titration curve for phosphate buffer, as obtained by programming in R.\"}\n#Define titration function and plot\nfa = function(pH,pKa) {\nx=0\nfor(i in 1:length(pKa)) {\nx = x+1/(1 + 10^(pH - pKa[i]))}\nreturn(x)\n}\npKa=c(2.2,7.2,12.7)\ncurve(fa(x,pKa),1,14, xlab=\"pH\", ylab=\"fa\",\ncol=2)\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Acetate system\n\n| The titration of a weak acid is based on the Henderson-Hasselbach equation as follows [@po2001henderson] :\n\n\\begin{equation}\npH = pKa + log\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\n\\label{hender-hassel}\n\\end{equation}\n\n| It turns out that we can treat the contents of $A^-$ and $HA$ not in absolute terms, but as fractions, both of base (*fb*) and acid (*fa*), such that:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfa+fb=1\n\\label{frac-tit}\n\\end{equation}\n\n| Thus, it can be defined that after a certain amount of base, the initial value of *HA*, in unitary fraction, will be *1-fb*; thus, the Henderson-Hasselbach expression can be written as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\npH = pKa + log\\frac{fb}{1-fb}\n\\label{HH-frac}\n\\end{equation}\n\nFrom this derivation, one can easily relate that:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfb = \\frac{10^{(pH-pKa)}} {1+10^{(pH-pKa)}}\n\\label{HH-fb}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAnd, similarly, one can find *fa* as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfa = 1- fb\n\\label{HH-fb2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nResulting in\n\n\\begin{equation}\nfa = \\frac{1}{1+10^{(pH-pKa)}}\n\\label{eq-HH-fa}\n\\end{equation}\n\n| In this way, it is possible to simulate by *R* a titration curve of any weak acid based on its pKa value.
