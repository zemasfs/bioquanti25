From a simplified point of view, enzyme activity can be reduced in the presence of several effectors, among endogenous or exogenous molecules of cellular metabolism, including the substrate itself. Generically, *enzyme inhibition* is classified as *irreversible* when the activity decreases due to the covalent binding of an inhibitor, or *reversible*, when there is an equilibrium of association/dissociation with the macromolecule. Reversible inhibitions will be illustrated below.\n\n### Inhibition by the substrate\n\n| A common enzyme inhibition in metabolism is caused by the substrate itself in excess in the medium, defined by:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{Vm*S}{S(1+\\frac{S}{Ks})+Km}\n$$ {#eq-eqInibS}\n\n| Thus, the graph resulting from an inhibition due to excess substrate can be reproduced by:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"fig-figInibS\", fig.cap = \"Kinetic behavior of an enzyme inhibited by excess substrate.\"}\n\n# Inhibition due to excess S\n\nS <- seq(0, 10, 0.1)\nv_alos <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, Ks = 2) {\nVm * S / (S * (1 + S / Ks) + Km)\n}\ncurve(v_alos, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\")\n```\n\n| It can be seen from @fig-figInibS that the enzyme activity reaches a limit and is reduced with increasing substrate content.\n\n### Enzyme inhibition models\n\n| Assuming the simplified relation below:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nE+S \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k1}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{k2} \\end{array} ES\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k3}\\\\\n\\rightarrow \\\\\n^{}\\end{array}E+P\n(\\#eq:diagMM)\n\\end{equation}\n```\n\n| Enzyme inhibition by molecules other than the substrate itself can be represented by a diagram in which the effector alters one of the elements represented in the above equation, as follows.\n\n\\\n```{r, label = \"inibDiag\", echo=FALSE, out.width=\"60%\", fig.cap=\"Diagram representing the types of enzyme inhibition. kcat: catalytic constant; Ki: equilibrium constant for dissociation of the inhibitor, with indices for competitive (Ki), uncompetitive (Kiu) and non-competitive (Kic and Kiu) inhibition.\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/inibDiag.png\")\n```\n\n| In this case, the three main types of reversible enzyme inhibition can be defined as *competitive, uncompetitive and non-competitive (pure or mixed) inhibition*. In summary, *competitive inhibition* occurs when the inhibitor complexes with the enzyme's active site; *uncompetitive inhibition*, when the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme-substrate complex; and *non-competitive inhibition*, when the inhibitor binds to a site other than the enzyme's active site, and can also be *pure* (Kiu = Kic) or *mixed* (Kiu > or < Kic).\n| A mathematical model that encompasses these three types of enzyme inhibition is described in the equation below:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{Vm*S}{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})+S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})}\n$$ {#eq-inibAll}\n\n| Thus, @eq-inibAll is reduced in its multiplying terms in the denominator, depending on the type of enzyme inhibition present, up to the primitive Michaelis-Mentem model, when there is no inhibitor.\n|\n\n#### Michaelis-Mentem curve for enzyme inhibition models\n\n| We can simulate in `R` the Michaelian curves for classical inhibition models, considering values ​​for the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constants such as Kic = 0.2, and Kiu = 1, as in the code snippet below.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"fig-inibMM\", fig.cap=\"Michaelis-Mentem curve in the presence of classical inhibitors.\"}\n\n# Classical inhibition & Michaelis-Mentem\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # divide the plot area\nS <- seq(0, 10, 0.1) # generation of S contents\ncontr <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5) {\nVm * S / (Km + S)\n} # MM function, without inhibition\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Competitive\")\n# control curve; note that the title has to be added for the 1a. of pair\n# of curves, control and inhibition\n\n# Inhibition models:\n\n# Competitive\ncomp.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kic = 0.2) {\nVm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S)\n}\ncurve(comp.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # competitive\n\n# Pure noncompetitive\npura.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Ki = 1) {\nVm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Ki) + S * (1 + I / Ki))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Pure Noncompet.\")\ncurve(pura.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # pure non-competitive (Kiu=Kic=Ki)\n\n# Mixed non-competitive\nmista.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kic = 0.2, Kiu = 1) {\n Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Non-Compet. Mixed\")\ncurve(mista.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # mixed non-competitive\n\n# Uncompetitive\nuncomp.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kiu = 1) {\nVm * S / (Km + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Uncompetitive\")\ncurve(uncomp.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # uncompetitive\nlayout(1) # returns to the original graphic window\n```\n\n| Note that for the *competitive model* the limiting reaction rate *Vm* tends to be reached, since the occupation of the enzyme's active site is mutually exclusive between substrate and inhibitor, favoring the former when in high concentration. On the other hand, the *Vm* value is not tangible for the other inhibition models, since the inhibitor binds to another site on the enzyme (*non-competitive*) or to the substrate itself (*uncompetitive*). To see changes in the graphs, try modifying the simulation parameters (Vm, Km, Ki, Kic, Kiu, I).\n| Although it is possible to distinguish the competitive model from the others, also note that this was only possible for a simulation that used an *S* content 20 times greater than the *Km* value of the reaction. This is not always possible in practice, as listed below, since the use of high *S* contents:\n\n1. Adds greater financial cost to the test.\n2. May result in inhibition due to excess substrate.\n3. May increase the viscosity of the medium, reducing the catalytic rate.\n\n| It can be seen from @fig-inibMM and the observations above that it is difficult to classify the type of enzyme inhibition based on direct observation of a Michaelis-Mentem curve.\n\n#### Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition models by Lineweaver-Burk\n\n| Linear transformations of the Michaelis-Mentem equation are very useful in the visual diagnosis of inhibition models. In this sense, the use of double-reciprocal linearization for these models will result in the following inhibition equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S} \\quad ;\\, competitive\n$$ {#eq-eqComp}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Ki})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Ki})} \\quad ;\\, pure\n$$ {#eq-eqPure}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})} \\quad ;\\, mixed\n$$ {#eq-eqMixed}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})} \\quad ;\\, uncompetitive\n$$ {#eq-eqIncomp}\n\n| Note that the multiplier terms inserted in *S* and *Km* in the double-reciprocal equation only change its formalism presented in the Lineweaver-Burk equation of the previous chapter. Thus, enzyme inhibition models can be illustrated by `R` together with the Lineweaver-Burk transformation (or any other), as below.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"inibLB\", warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition models by Lineweaver-Burk.\"}\n# Diagnosis of inhibition by Lineweaver-Burk\n\n# Substrate and Inhibitor\nS <- seq(0.1, 10, length = 10) # create a vector for substrate\nI <- 2 # inhibitor concentration\n\n# Kinetic parameters:\nKm <- 0.5\nVm <- 10\nKic <- 0.2\nKi <- 0.2\nKiu <- 1\n\n# Equations\nv <- Vm * S / (Km + S) # MM equation\nv.comp <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S) # competitive\nv.pure <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Ki) + S * (1 + I / Ki))\n # pure non-competitive\nv.mixed <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n # mixed non-competitive\nv.incomp <- Vm * S / (Km + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n\n# Graphics\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # plot area for 4 graphs\n\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Competitive\", ylim = c(0, 2))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.comp, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Pure\", ylim = c(0, 5))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Mixed\", ylim = c(0, 2))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.mixed, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Uncompetitive\", ylim = c(0, 1))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.incomp, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\n\nlayout(1) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| Now the distinction of inhibition models becomes more evident by linearization. As mentioned for the models represented in the direct Michaelis-Mentem equation, one can vary the kinetic parameters and experiment with the visualization of double reciprocals.\n| Again, although linearization allows a better diagnosis of the type of inhibition present, nonlinear adjustment is more appropriate for determining inhibition constants (*Ki'*s), since it does not include errors arising from linear transformations (although the insertion of statistical weights can alleviate the imprecision of the results).\n\n#### Ki & IC$_{50}$\n\n| The inhibitory concentration at 50% of the inhibitor content, defined as *IC$_{50}$*, can be determined empirically without knowledge of the enzyme catalysis parameters involved. To do so, it is enough to obtain a relative inhibition value in a test at a fixed concentration of *S*, varying the inhibitor content. In fact, analogues to *IC$_{50}$* exist in a wide range in the Natural Sciences, not involving necessarily any kinetic or thermodynamic information of the compounds involved, but only the empirical information of the result. For example, the parameters *DE$_{50}$* (effective dose) or *DL$_{50}$* (lethal dose), and even projections of *X$_{50}$*, such as *Tm* (denaturation temperature at 50%), and the value of *pKa* in buffers (pH at which the species are 50% ionized/protonated in solution).\n\n| However, there is a useful relationship between the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant *Ki* and the value of *IC$_{50}$* that allows their exchange, as long as the inhibition model is known [@yung1973relationship]. Generalizing to inhibition models, a general equation for the Cheng-Prusoff relation can be defined as:\n\n$$\nIC_{50} = \\frac{(1+\\frac{S}{Km})}{(\\frac{1}{Kic})+(\\frac{1}{Km*Kiu})}\n$$ {#eq-eqCPrusso}\n\n| For example, for a *competitive* inhibition model, where *Kiu* is zero:\n\n$$\nIC_{50} = Kic(1+\\frac{S}{Km})\n$$ {#eq-eqPrusfComp}\n\n| As mentioned above, the value of *IC$_{50}$* can be obtained from experimental data of relative inhibition (*v/Vm*, for example) at different inhibitor concentrations by setting a value of *S*. In this case, we can illustrate in `R` the obtaining of *IC$_{50}$*, using a non-linear fit to the following four-parameter equation (*Rodbard curve*, @delean1978simultaneous).\n\n$$\nresidual act. \\, \\% =\\frac{v}{Vm} = inf+\\frac{sup-inf}{1+log(\\frac{I}{IC_{50}})^{nH}})\n$$ {#eq:eqRodb}\n\n```{r,echo=TRUE}\n# Non-linear fit to IC50 curve\n\nlogI.nM <- c(5.5, 5.2, 4.9, 4.6, 4.3, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.8)\n# conc. of I, in log10 units\nativ.res <- c(0.02, 0.07, 0.12, 0.22, 0.36, 0.53, 0.67, 0.83, 0.85)\n# ativ. residual, v/Vm\ndata <- data.frame(logI.nM, ativ.res) # create dataframe\nplot(ativ.res ~ logI.nM, data) # plot data\nic50.fit <- nls(formula(ativ.res ~ inf + (sup - inf) /\n(1 + (logI.nM / logIC50)^nH)),\nalgorithm = \"port\", data = data,\nstart = list(inf = 0, sup = 0.80, logIC50 = 4, nH = 10),\nlower = c(inf = -Inf, sup = -Inf,\nlogIC50 = 0, nH = -Inf)) # nonlinear fit\nsummary(ic50.fit) # fit summary\nlines(logI.nM, fitted(ic50.fit), col = \"blue\") # fitted line\n\n# And to extract the value of IC50...\nIC50 <- 10^(coef(ic50.fit)[3]) # extraction of the 3rd parameter from the\n# fitting table, that is: logIC50:\nIC50\n```\n\n| Note that the *logIC50* parameter was extracted from the nonlinear fitting table by the `coef` command. This is very useful when we want to use a coefficient obtained in automatic (programmable) calculations, as we will see later. For now, it is interesting to present the *IC50* parameter obtained in a more elegant way.\n| To do this, we can use two `R` functions to express quantitative results together with characters (words, sentences): `print()` and `cat`. The code snippet below illustrates this *output*, and some differences.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\ncat(\"IC50 Value (nM):\", IC50, \"\\n\")\nprint(paste(\"IC50 Value (nM):\", IC50))\n```\n\n| Basically, `print` displays quotes and indexes the column name, while `cat` omits them. In addition, another variation in the printing format between the two commands can be seen in the example below:\n\n```{r, echo =TRUE}\nprint(paste(\"teores:\", c(10, 25, 50)))\ncat(\"teores:\", c(10, 25, 50))\n```\n\n| Another possibility in `R` is to reduce the number of decimal places displayed. In this case, the `round` command can be used.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nIC50 <- 10^(coef(ic50.fit)[3])\nprint(paste(\"IC50 value (nM):\", round(IC50, digits = 2)))\n# rounding to two decimal places\n```\n| Once again, it is worth highlighting the existence of some useful `R` packages for calculating *IC50*, including the `drc` package (*dose-response curve*).\n\n## Statistical diagnosis of enzyme inhibition\n\n| In parallel with the visual inspection of linearization graphs for enzyme inhibition, it is possible to validate one model over another by analyzing the dispersion of model errors. But it is also possible to use the `BIC` function or the `AIC` function of `R`, which respectively calculate values ​​for the *Baysean Information Criterion* [@spiess2010evaluation] or the *Akaike Information Criterion* [@akaike1974new]. In common, these parameters calculate a relative value of information not computed by an evaluated model. The lowest value found for both reflects the solution of the best fitting model.\n| Mathematically, *BIC* and *AIC* can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nBIC = p*ln(n)-2*ln(RSE)\\\\\n\\\\\nAIC = n*ln(\\frac{RSE}{n})+2k+[\\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}])\\\\\n$$ {#eq-BICAIC}\n\nWhere *p* represents the no. of model parameters, *n* the total number of experimental points, *k* the factor *p+1*, and *RSE* the value of the sum of squares of the residuals (*residual sum squares*).\n\n| To exemplify the use of these quality parameters of the statistical model, one can use a dataset contained in the `nlstools` package, providing the fitting, plotting, inspection of residuals, and application of *BIC* and *AIC*:\n\n```{r, AIC}\n\n# Application of information criteria for fitting kinetic curves\n\nlibrary(nlstools)\ncomp <- nls(compet_mich, vmkmki, list(Km = 1, Vmax = 20, Ki = 0.5))\n# competitive fitting, with data, equation and seeds provided\n# by the nlstools package\nplotfit(comp, variable = 1) # plotting command of the package\nsummary(comp)\nres_comp <- nlsResiduals(comp) # residuals of the fit\nplot(res_comp, which = 1) # plotting of residuals\n\nnoncomp <- nls(non_compet_mich, vmkmki, list(Km = 1, Vmax = 20, Ki = 0.5))\n# same as above, but for the non-competitive model\nplotfit(noncomp, variable = 1)\nsummary(noncomp)\nres_noncomp <- nlsResiduals(noncomp)\nplot(res_noncomp, which = 1)\n\nBIC(comp, noncomp) # Bayesian information criterion\nAIC(comp, noncomp) # Akaike information criterion\n```\n\n| It can be seen in the comparison of the non-linear fits that the non-competitive model fitted better than the competitive model (lower values ​​for BIC and AIC)\n\n## Pre-steady state kinetics\n\n| There are basically three types of kinetic behavior for enzymes: Henry-Michaelis-Mentem-Briggs-Haldane behavior, succinctly called Michaelian or steady-state behavior, lag-phase behavior (when the substrate takes some time to be converted to product), and burst, transient, or pre-steady-state behavior (when a phase with rapid product release precedes the steady state). Some enzymes work following burst kinetics, including some nucleosidases and glycosidases, and dehalogenases [@johnson19921,@tang2003kinetic].\n| Pre-steady-state kinetics follows a slightly different formalism, which depends on the number of reaction steps. Example below for a 3-step reaction [@johnson19921]:\n\n$$\nE+S \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k1}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{km1} \\end{array}\nE*S\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k2}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{km2} \\end{array}\nE*P\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k3}\\\\\n\\rightarrow \\\\\n^{}\\end{array}\nE+P\n$$ {#eq-burst}\n\n| In this case, the equations derived from the experimental observations, and which lead to the determination of the rate constants are:\n\n$$\nkobs=k2+km2+k3\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs1}\n\n$$\nAo=\\frac{k2*(k2+km2)}{kobs^2}\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs2}\n\n$$\nkcat=\\frac{k2*k3}{kobs}\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs3}\n\nWhere *kobs* and *Ao* represent experimental parameters of observed rate constant and amplitude, respectively. These parameters can be obtained from the nonlinear fit of the equation below to the experimental data:\n\n$$\nP=Ao(1-e^ {-kobs} + kcat * t)\n$$ {#eq-burstP}\n\n| The following code snippet simulates a pre-stationary behavior curve, when the rate constants that determine the experimental parameters are known.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"fig-figBurst\", fig.cap=\"Product formation in a pre-steady state kinetic model.\"}\n\n# MM curve in pre-steady state enzyme\n\n# Parameters\nk2 <- 387\nkm2 <- 3\nk3 <- 22\nxmin <- 0\nxmax <- 0.075 # definition of limits for function\n\n# Variables of the simulation equation (function of parameters)\nkobs <- k2 + km2 + k3\nAo <- k2 * (k2 + km2) / kobs^2\nkcat <- k2 * k3 / kobs\n\n# Definition of the simulation function\nsim <- function(x, kobs, Ao, kcat) {\nAo * (1 - exp(-kobs * x)) + kcat * x\n}\n\n# Simulation curve\ncurve(sim(x, kobs = kobs, Ao = Ao, kcat = kcat),\ncol = \"blue\",\ntype = \"o\", xlim = c(xmin, xmax), cex = 0.5,\nxlab = \"time\", ylab = \"[P]\"\n)\n```\n\n| Note from @fig-figBurst that in transient state kinetics, there is an initial pre-stationary phase that rapidly increases the product content *P*, and that precedes the stationary phase of constant release of *P*.\n\n| On the other hand, sometimes the opposite is necessary, that is, to determine the rate constants from knowledge of the experimental parameters *kobs* and *Ao*. In this case (and in many other transdisciplinary cases) `R` has minimization functions that allow finding the root of linear or nonlinear equations.\n| The procedure involves iteratively minimizing a vector of equations given the seeds for each parameter. To do this, we seek to obtain *f(x) = 0* by the difference between a reference value; that is, when the solution finds *x* when *f(x)-y = 0*. For example, suppose that f(x) is *a+b/x*, and that y is 3. Then the search is to find *a* and *b* in *a+b/x-3*.\n| To determine the rate constants represented in transient kinetics, it is worth mentioning the `optim` function in `stats` or the `rootSolve` package, which seek to minimize linear and nonlinear equations to find the values ​​of their parameters.\n| In the solution of the parameters for pre-steady state, the use of `R` with `rootSolve` is illustrated below, also adding the search for *Km* as follows.\n\n$$\nKm = \\frac{k3}{k2+k3}\n$$ {#eq:burstKm}\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\n# Calculation of kinetic constants by solving a system of nonlinear\n# equations applied to burst kinetics.\n\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nkobs <- 0.06\nAo <- 50\nkcat <- 300\nKs <- 15\n# defines the nonlinear fitting parameters obtained by progressive curve\n# experimental, t x P; # Note: Ks obtained experimentally from the S x kobs curve\n\n# Parameters\n# x[1]=k2\n# x[2]= k3\n# x[3] = Km\n\n# Model\nmodel <- function(x) c(x[1] / kobs^2 - Ao, (x[1] * x[2]) / kobs - kcat,\nKs * x[2] / (x[1] + x[2]) - x[3])\n# the model above must contain a list of equations whose equality is zero,\n# that is, f(x)=0\n(ss <- multiroot(model, c(1, 1, 1))) # rootSolve execution command\n# (seeds for the algorithm)\n```\n\n| The results of the minimization can be interpreted as:\n\n1. *root* = values of xi for f(xi)=0 ; that is, *k2, k3, and Km*; 2. *f.root* = value of each function for each xi (must be close to zero for each);\n3. *iter* = no. iterations;\n4. *esti.precis* = precision estimate.\n\n| Considering an extensive chapter on enzyme kinetics, there are numerous topics left out, given the main focus of using `R` in solving quantitative problems in biophysical chemistry. Thus, we omit several concepts, such as *slow kinetics of substrate interaction (slow binding), kinetics of multiple substrates (sequential and ping-pong reactions), integrated Michaelis-Menten equation and progressive curves, activation of modulators, influence of pH and temperature on catalysis, and multisite enzymes*, among others.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n# kinetics by eq. ordinary differential\n# complete kinetic analysis with loop, plots, diagnostics\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Types of inhibition\n\n| A vast chapter in enzymology and with direct application in Chemistry, Pharmacology, Biotechnology, Biomedicine and related areas, enzyme inhibition is at the heart of drugs, medicines and biosensors.

In summary, *competitive inhibition* occurs when the inhibitor complexes with the enzyme's active site; *uncompetitive inhibition*, when the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme-substrate complex; and *non-competitive inhibition*, when the inhibitor binds to a site other than the enzyme's active site, and can also be *pure* (Kiu = Kic) or *mixed* (Kiu > or < Kic).\n| A mathematical model that encompasses these three types of enzyme inhibition is described in the equation below:\n\n$$\nv=\\frac{Vm*S}{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})+S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})}\n$$ {#eq-inibAll}\n\n| Thus, @eq-inibAll is reduced in its multiplying terms in the denominator, depending on the type of enzyme inhibition present, up to the primitive Michaelis-Mentem model, when there is no inhibitor.\n|\n\n#### Michaelis-Mentem curve for enzyme inhibition models\n\n| We can simulate in `R` the Michaelian curves for classical inhibition models, considering values ​​for the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constants such as Kic = 0.2, and Kiu = 1, as in the code snippet below.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"fig-inibMM\", fig.cap=\"Michaelis-Mentem curve in the presence of classical inhibitors.\"}\n\n# Classical inhibition & Michaelis-Mentem\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # divide the plot area\nS <- seq(0, 10, 0.1) # generation of S contents\ncontr <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5) {\nVm * S / (Km + S)\n} # MM function, without inhibition\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Competitive\")\n# control curve; note that the title has to be added for the 1a. of pair\n# of curves, control and inhibition\n\n# Inhibition models:\n\n# Competitive\ncomp.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kic = 0.2) {\nVm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S)\n}\ncurve(comp.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # competitive\n\n# Pure noncompetitive\npura.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Ki = 1) {\nVm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Ki) + S * (1 + I / Ki))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Pure Noncompet.\")\ncurve(pura.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # pure non-competitive (Kiu=Kic=Ki)\n\n# Mixed non-competitive\nmista.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kic = 0.2, Kiu = 1) {\n Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Non-Compet. Mixed\")\ncurve(mista.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # mixed non-competitive\n\n# Uncompetitive\nuncomp.i <- function(S, Vm = 10, Km = 0.5, I = 2, Kiu = 1) {\nVm * S / (Km + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n}\ncurve(contr, xlim = c(0, 10), xlab = \"S\", ylab = \"v\", main = \"Uncompetitive\")\ncurve(uncomp.i, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # uncompetitive\nlayout(1) # returns to the original graphic window\n```\n\n| Note that for the *competitive model* the limiting reaction rate *Vm* tends to be reached, since the occupation of the enzyme's active site is mutually exclusive between substrate and inhibitor, favoring the former when in high concentration. On the other hand, the *Vm* value is not tangible for the other inhibition models, since the inhibitor binds to another site on the enzyme (*non-competitive*) or to the substrate itself (*uncompetitive*). To see changes in the graphs, try modifying the simulation parameters (Vm, Km, Ki, Kic, Kiu, I).\n| Although it is possible to distinguish the competitive model from the others, also note that this was only possible for a simulation that used an *S* content 20 times greater than the *Km* value of the reaction. This is not always possible in practice, as listed below, since the use of high *S* contents:\n\n1. Adds greater financial cost to the test.\n2. May result in inhibition due to excess substrate.\n3. May increase the viscosity of the medium, reducing the catalytic rate.\n\n| It can be seen from @fig-inibMM and the observations above that it is difficult to classify the type of enzyme inhibition based on direct observation of a Michaelis-Mentem curve.\n\n#### Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition models by Lineweaver-Burk\n\n| Linear transformations of the Michaelis-Mentem equation are very useful in the visual diagnosis of inhibition models. In this sense, the use of double-reciprocal linearization for these models will result in the following inhibition equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S} \\quad ;\\, competitive\n$$ {#eq-eqComp}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Ki})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Ki})} \\quad ;\\, pure\n$$ {#eq-eqPure}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})} \\quad ;\\, mixed\n$$ {#eq-eqMixed}\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v}=\\frac{1}{Vm}+\\frac{Km}{Vm}*\\frac{1}{S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})} \\quad ;\\, uncompetitive\n$$ {#eq-eqIncomp}\n\n| Note that the multiplier terms inserted in *S* and *Km* in the double-reciprocal equation only change its formalism presented in the Lineweaver-Burk equation of the previous chapter. Thus, enzyme inhibition models can be illustrated by `R` together with the Lineweaver-Burk transformation (or any other), as below.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"inibLB\", warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Diagnosis of enzyme inhibition models by Lineweaver-Burk.\"}\n# Diagnosis of inhibition by Lineweaver-Burk\n\n# Substrate and Inhibitor\nS <- seq(0.1, 10, length = 10) # create a vector for substrate\nI <- 2 # inhibitor concentration\n\n# Kinetic parameters:\nKm <- 0.5\nVm <- 10\nKic <- 0.2\nKi <- 0.2\nKiu <- 1\n\n# Equations\nv <- Vm * S / (Km + S) # MM equation\nv.comp <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S) # competitive\nv.pure <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Ki) + S * (1 + I / Ki))\n # pure non-competitive\nv.mixed <- Vm * S / (Km * (1 + I / Kic) + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n # mixed non-competitive\nv.incomp <- Vm * S / (Km + S * (1 + I / Kiu))\n\n# Graphics\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2)) # plot area for 4 graphs\n\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Competitive\", ylim = c(0, 2))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.comp, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Pure\", ylim = c(0, 5))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Mixed\", ylim = c(0, 2))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.mixed, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(1 / S, 1 / v, type = \"l\", main = \"Uncompetitive\", ylim = c(0, 1))\npoints(1 / S, 1 / v.incomp, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\n\nlayout(1) # return to normal graphics window\n```\n\n| Now the distinction of inhibition models becomes more evident by linearization. As mentioned for the models represented in the direct Michaelis-Mentem equation, one can vary the kinetic parameters and experiment with the visualization of double reciprocals.\n| Again, although linearization allows a better diagnosis of the type of inhibition present, nonlinear adjustment is more appropriate for determining inhibition constants (*Ki'*s), since it does not include errors arising from linear transformations (although the insertion of statistical weights can alleviate the imprecision of the results).\n\n#### Ki & IC$_{50}$\n\n| The inhibitory concentration at 50% of the inhibitor content, defined as *IC$_{50}$*, can be determined empirically without knowledge of the enzyme catalysis parameters involved. To do so, it is enough to obtain a relative inhibition value in a test at a fixed concentration of *S*, varying the inhibitor content. In fact, analogues to *IC$_{50}$* exist in a wide range in the Natural Sciences, not involving necessarily any kinetic or thermodynamic information of the compounds involved, but only the empirical information of the result. For example, the parameters *DE$_{50}$* (effective dose) or *DL$_{50}$* (lethal dose), and even projections of *X$_{50}$*, such as *Tm* (denaturation temperature at 50%), and the value of *pKa* in buffers (pH at which the species are 50% ionized/protonated in solution).\n\n| However, there is a useful relationship between the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant *Ki* and the value of *IC$_{50}$* that allows their exchange, as long as the inhibition model is known [@yung1973relationship]. Generalizing to inhibition models, a general equation for the Cheng-Prusoff relation can be defined as:\n\n$$\nIC_{50} = \\frac{(1+\\frac{S}{Km})}{(\\frac{1}{Kic})+(\\frac{1}{Km*Kiu})}\n$$ {#eq-eqCPrusso}\n\n| For example, for a *competitive* inhibition model, where *Kiu* is zero:\n\n$$\nIC_{50} = Kic(1+\\frac{S}{Km})\n$$ {#eq-eqPrusfComp}\n\n| As mentioned above, the value of *IC$_{50}$* can be obtained from experimental data of relative inhibition (*v/Vm*, for example) at different inhibitor concentrations by setting a value of *S*. In this case, we can illustrate in `R` the obtaining of *IC$_{50}$*, using a non-linear fit to the following four-parameter equation (*Rodbard curve*, @delean1978simultaneous).\n\n$$\nresidual act. \\, \\% =\\frac{v}{Vm} = inf+\\frac{sup-inf}{1+log(\\frac{I}{IC_{50}})^{nH}})\n$$ {#eq:eqRodb}\n\n```{r,echo=TRUE}\n# Non-linear fit to IC50 curve\n\nlogI.nM <- c(5.5, 5.2, 4.9, 4.6, 4.3, 3.7, 3.3, 3, 2.8)\n# conc. of I, in log10 units\nativ.res <- c(0.02, 0.07, 0.12, 0.22, 0.36, 0.53, 0.67, 0.83, 0.85)\n# ativ. residual, v/Vm\ndata <- data.frame(logI.nM, ativ.res) # create dataframe\nplot(ativ.res ~ logI.nM, data) # plot data\nic50.fit <- nls(formula(ativ.res ~ inf + (sup - inf) /\n(1 + (logI.nM / logIC50)^nH)),\nalgorithm = \"port\", data = data,\nstart = list(inf = 0, sup = 0.80, logIC50 = 4, nH = 10),\nlower = c(inf = -Inf, sup = -Inf,\nlogIC50 = 0, nH = -Inf)) # nonlinear fit\nsummary(ic50.fit) # fit summary\nlines(logI.nM, fitted(ic50.fit), col = \"blue\") # fitted line\n\n# And to extract the value of IC50...\nIC50 <- 10^(coef(ic50.fit)[3]) # extraction of the 3rd parameter from the\n# fitting table, that is: logIC50:\nIC50\n```\n\n| Note that the *logIC50* parameter was extracted from the nonlinear fitting table by the `coef` command. This is very useful when we want to use a coefficient obtained in automatic (programmable) calculations, as we will see later. For now, it is interesting to present the *IC50* parameter obtained in a more elegant way.\n| To do this, we can use two `R` functions to express quantitative results together with characters (words, sentences): `print()` and `cat`. The code snippet below illustrates this *output*, and some differences.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\ncat(\"IC50 Value (nM):\", IC50, \"\\n\")\nprint(paste(\"IC50 Value (nM):\", IC50))\n```\n\n| Basically, `print` displays quotes and indexes the column name, while `cat` omits them. In addition, another variation in the printing format between the two commands can be seen in the example below:\n\n```{r, echo =TRUE}\nprint(paste(\"teores:\", c(10, 25, 50)))\ncat(\"teores:\", c(10, 25, 50))\n```\n\n| Another possibility in `R` is to reduce the number of decimal places displayed. In this case, the `round` command can be used.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nIC50 <- 10^(coef(ic50.fit)[3])\nprint(paste(\"IC50 value (nM):\", round(IC50, digits = 2)))\n# rounding to two decimal places\n```\n| Once again, it is worth highlighting the existence of some useful `R` packages for calculating *IC50*, including the `drc` package (*dose-response curve*).\n\n## Statistical diagnosis of enzyme inhibition\n\n| In parallel with the visual inspection of linearization graphs for enzyme inhibition, it is possible to validate one model over another by analyzing the dispersion of model errors. But it is also possible to use the `BIC` function or the `AIC` function of `R`, which respectively calculate values ​​for the *Baysean Information Criterion* [@spiess2010evaluation] or the *Akaike Information Criterion* [@akaike1974new]. In common, these parameters calculate a relative value of information not computed by an evaluated model. The lowest value found for both reflects the solution of the best fitting model.\n| Mathematically, *BIC* and *AIC* can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nBIC = p*ln(n)-2*ln(RSE)\\\\\n\\\\\nAIC = n*ln(\\frac{RSE}{n})+2k+[\\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}])\\\\\n$$ {#eq-BICAIC}\n\nWhere *p* represents the no. of model parameters, *n* the total number of experimental points, *k* the factor *p+1*, and *RSE* the value of the sum of squares of the residuals (*residual sum squares*).\n\n| To exemplify the use of these quality parameters of the statistical model, one can use a dataset contained in the `nlstools` package, providing the fitting, plotting, inspection of residuals, and application of *BIC* and *AIC*:\n\n```{r, AIC}\n\n# Application of information criteria for fitting kinetic curves\n\nlibrary(nlstools)\ncomp <- nls(compet_mich, vmkmki, list(Km = 1, Vmax = 20, Ki = 0.5))\n# competitive fitting, with data, equation and seeds provided\n# by the nlstools package\nplotfit(comp, variable = 1) # plotting command of the package\nsummary(comp)\nres_comp <- nlsResiduals(comp) # residuals of the fit\nplot(res_comp, which = 1) # plotting of residuals\n\nnoncomp <- nls(non_compet_mich, vmkmki, list(Km = 1, Vmax = 20, Ki = 0.5))\n# same as above, but for the non-competitive model\nplotfit(noncomp, variable = 1)\nsummary(noncomp)\nres_noncomp <- nlsResiduals(noncomp)\nplot(res_noncomp, which = 1)\n\nBIC(comp, noncomp) # Bayesian information criterion\nAIC(comp, noncomp) # Akaike information criterion\n```\n\n| It can be seen in the comparison of the non-linear fits that the non-competitive model fitted better than the competitive model (lower values ​​for BIC and AIC)\n\n## Pre-steady state kinetics\n\n| There are basically three types of kinetic behavior for enzymes: Henry-Michaelis-Mentem-Briggs-Haldane behavior, succinctly called Michaelian or steady-state behavior, lag-phase behavior (when the substrate takes some time to be converted to product), and burst, transient, or pre-steady-state behavior (when a phase with rapid product release precedes the steady state). Some enzymes work following burst kinetics, including some nucleosidases and glycosidases, and dehalogenases [@johnson19921,@tang2003kinetic].\n| Pre-steady-state kinetics follows a slightly different formalism, which depends on the number of reaction steps. Example below for a 3-step reaction [@johnson19921]:\n\n$$\nE+S \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k1}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{km1} \\end{array}\nE*S\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k2}\\\\\n\\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{km2} \\end{array}\nE*P\n\\begin{array}{c}\n_{k3}\\\\\n\\rightarrow \\\\\n^{}\\end{array}\nE+P\n$$ {#eq-burst}\n\n| In this case, the equations derived from the experimental observations, and which lead to the determination of the rate constants are:\n\n$$\nkobs=k2+km2+k3\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs1}\n\n$$\nAo=\\frac{k2*(k2+km2)}{kobs^2}\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs2}\n\n$$\nkcat=\\frac{k2*k3}{kobs}\n$$ {#eq-burstKobs3}\n\nWhere *kobs* and *Ao* represent experimental parameters of observed rate constant and amplitude, respectively. These parameters can be obtained from the nonlinear fit of the equation below to the experimental data:\n\n$$\nP=Ao(1-e^ {-kobs} + kcat * t)\n$$ {#eq-burstP}\n\n| The following code snippet simulates a pre-stationary behavior curve, when the rate constants that determine the experimental parameters are known.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE, label = \"fig-figBurst\", fig.cap=\"Product formation in a pre-steady state kinetic model.\"}\n\n# MM curve in pre-steady state enzyme\n\n# Parameters\nk2 <- 387\nkm2 <- 3\nk3 <- 22\nxmin <- 0\nxmax <- 0.075 # definition of limits for function\n\n# Variables of the simulation equation (function of parameters)\nkobs <- k2 + km2 + k3\nAo <- k2 * (k2 + km2) / kobs^2\nkcat <- k2 * k3 / kobs\n\n# Definition of the simulation function\nsim <- function(x, kobs, Ao, kcat) {\nAo * (1 - exp(-kobs * x)) + kcat * x\n}\n\n# Simulation curve\ncurve(sim(x, kobs = kobs, Ao = Ao, kcat = kcat),\ncol = \"blue\",\ntype = \"o\", xlim = c(xmin, xmax), cex = 0.5,\nxlab = \"time\", ylab = \"[P]\"\n)\n```\n\n| Note from @fig-figBurst that in transient state kinetics, there is an initial pre-stationary phase that rapidly increases the product content *P*, and that precedes the stationary phase of constant release of *P*.\n\n| On the other hand, sometimes the opposite is necessary, that is, to determine the rate constants from knowledge of the experimental parameters *kobs* and *Ao*. In this case (and in many other transdisciplinary cases) `R` has minimization functions that allow finding the root of linear or nonlinear equations.\n| The procedure involves iteratively minimizing a vector of equations given the seeds for each parameter. To do this, we seek to obtain *f(x) = 0* by the difference between a reference value; that is, when the solution finds *x* when *f(x)-y = 0*. For example, suppose that f(x) is *a+b/x*, and that y is 3. Then the search is to find *a* and *b* in *a+b/x-3*.\n| To determine the rate constants represented in transient kinetics, it is worth mentioning the `optim` function in `stats` or the `rootSolve` package, which seek to minimize linear and nonlinear equations to find the values ​​of their parameters.\n| In the solution of the parameters for pre-steady state, the use of `R` with `rootSolve` is illustrated below, also adding the search for *Km* as follows.\n\n$$\nKm = \\frac{k3}{k2+k3}\n$$ {#eq:burstKm}\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\n# Calculation of kinetic constants by solving a system of nonlinear\n# equations applied to burst kinetics.\n\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nkobs <- 0.06\nAo <- 50\nkcat <- 300\nKs <- 15\n# defines the nonlinear fitting parameters obtained by progressive curve\n# experimental, t x P; # Note: Ks obtained experimentally from the S x kobs curve\n\n# Parameters\n# x[1]=k2\n# x[2]= k3\n# x[3] = Km\n\n# Model\nmodel <- function(x) c(x[1] / kobs^2 - Ao, (x[1] * x[2]) / kobs - kcat,\nKs * x[2] / (x[1] + x[2]) - x[3])\n# the model above must contain a list of equations whose equality is zero,\n# that is, f(x)=0\n(ss <- multiroot(model, c(1, 1, 1))) # rootSolve execution command\n# (seeds for the algorithm)\n```\n\n| The results of the minimization can be interpreted as:\n\n1. *root* = values of xi for f(xi)=0 ; that is, *k2, k3, and Km*; 2. *f.root* = value of each function for each xi (must be close to zero for each);\n3. *iter* = no. iterations;\n4. *esti.precis* = precision estimate.\n\n| Considering an extensive chapter on enzyme kinetics, there are numerous topics left out, given the main focus of using `R` in solving quantitative problems in biophysical chemistry. Thus, we omit several concepts, such as *slow kinetics of substrate interaction (slow binding), kinetics of multiple substrates (sequential and ping-pong reactions), integrated Michaelis-Menten equation and progressive curves, activation of modulators, influence of pH and temperature on catalysis, and multisite enzymes*, among others.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}\n# kinetics by eq.
