In this sense, the program was designed to facilitate the insertion of reagents and metabolic pathways, **simulating what would be drawn with a pencil and a blank sheet of paper**.\n \n\nThe program was written in Java and allows you to dynamically visualize and evaluate the transformation of reactants and products in an isolated reaction, a metabolic flow, or complex maps. The name Sisma refers to the acronym for Autocatalytic Map System. The program performs a visual and quantitative simulation on a reaction map, by perceiving *variations in the hue of the objects* involved in each transformation, either from a *default* equation or one introduced by the user. The program is registered under no. 08869-3 with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI).\n<br />\n\n\n| For the study of the relationships between reactants and products, the program allows the insertion of compounds (*Object*), paths (*Path*), figures and annotations on the map, storage and reading of maps, simulation of variations in the relative contents of each compound by point and line graphs simultaneously with those occurring on the map itself, pause, interruption, backward and forward viewing at any time during the simulation, automatically generate and export spreadsheets containing the numerical values of each object transformed at each instant, and instantly print the map at the point of a desired transformation. In this way, the program makes the visualization of *forces and flows* that are presented statically in diagrams and maps dynamic, both in *Biochemistry* and for any subject involving this type of representation.\n\\\n\n| Despite its ease of use with a mouse, without the need to enter text commands, *Sisma* allows the modification of all elements of the map (objects, paths, equations, names, colors, positions) by editing the map file in a notepad, adding value to *Reproducible Teaching* with the tool.
