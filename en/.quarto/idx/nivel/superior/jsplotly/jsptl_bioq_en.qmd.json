In this equation, coefficients are calculated that estimate the existence of a volume and interparticle interactions.

Models can be linear or non-linear. When non-linear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\n \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual grid search*. In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair \n\\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

Enzymatic catalysis in the absence of inhibitor.\"\n1. Just run the application with the general equation. Note that the values for Kic and Kiu are high (1e20). Thus, with high \"dissociation constants,\" the interaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme is irrelevant, returning the model to the classic Michaelis-Mentem equation.\n2. Try changing the values of Vm and Km, comparing graphs.\n3. Use the geographic coordinates feature on the icon bar (\"Toggle Spike Lines\") to consolidate the mathematical meaning of Km, as well as to observe the effect of different values on the graph.\n\n\"B. Competitive inhibition model.\"\n1. To observe or compare the Michaelis model with the competitive inhibition model, simply replace the value of Kic with a consistent number (e.g., Kic= 3).\n\n\"C.

This simulation deals with a thermal denaturation curve for DNA in the presence or absence of some of these compounds: trehalose (stabilizing osmolyte) and guanidine chloride (destabilizing).\n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\ny(T) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\frac{T - T_m}{\\beta}}}\n$$\n\n\n*Where*,\n\n- y(T): fraction of denatured DNA at a given temperature T;\n- Tm: transition temperature (*melting*, temperature at which 50% of molecules are double-stranded and 50% are single-stranded);\n- $\\beta$: parameter that adjusts the slope of the curve (affected by trehalose and guanidine).\n\n\n*Note:*\n\n1. Trehalose as a stabilizer (reduces $\\beta$);\n2.

In this equation, coefficients are calculated that estimate the existence of a volume and interparticle interactions. Thus, the van der Waals equation corrects the ideal gas equation by considering a term to compensate for intermolecular forces (a/V$^{2}$) and the available volume, which discounts the volume occupied by the gas molecules themselves.\n\n\n| The simulation offers additional interactivity through the presence of sliders for temperature and for the finite volume coefficient (*b*) and particle interaction coefficient (*a*).\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{RT}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2}\n$$\n\n- P = gas pressure (atm);\n- V = molar volume (L);\n- T = temperature (K);\n- R = 0.0821 = ideal gas constant (L·atm/mol·K);\n- a = intermolecular attraction constant (L$^{2}$·atm/mol$^{2})\n- b = excluded volume constant (L/mol)\n\n\n\n[![](Eq/vanderWaals.png)](Eq/jsp_vanderWaals.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\n1.

By varying one or both reactant concentrations or physical-chemical parameters, it is possible to quantify the product using the following thermodynamic reaction:\n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ'} + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{ADP}] \\cdot [\\text{P}_i]}{[\\text{ATP}]}\\right) + 2{,}303 \\cdot RT \\cdot n_H \\cdot \\text{pH}\n$$\n\n*Where*,\n\n- $\\Delta$G = Gibbs energy of the reaction (positive for spontaneously unfavorable synthesis, kJ/mol);\n- $\\Delta$G$^{o'}$ = 30.5 kJ/mol standard biological Gibbs energy for ATP synthesis;\n- R = 8.314 J/mol/K (universal gas constant);\n- T=310 K (physiological temperature);\n- nH$^{+}$ = 1 (number of protons involved in the reaction);\n- [ADP], [Pi], [ATP] = molar concentrations of reactants and product\n\n\n[![](Eq/ATP.png)](Eq/jsp_ATP.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

This expanded form of the Gibbs equation for variable heat capacity is found in various biochemical phenomena, such as in the phase transition of biomembrane structures subjected to a compound challenge, or in the conformational change that accompanies the protein structure under heating. \\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\n\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\,\\Delta S^\\circ + \\Delta C_p \\left(T - T_0 - T \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n*Where*,\n\n- $\\Delta$G(T) = Gibbs energy of the reaction at each temperature value, kJ/mol);\n- $\\Delta$H$^{o}$ = standard enthalpy of the reaction at T$_{0}$, normally 298 K (J/mol);\n- $\\Delta$S$^{o}$ = standard entropy of the reaction at T$_{0}$;\n- $\\Delta$Cp = variation in the heat capacity of the reaction (J/mol·K), assumed to be constant with temperature;\n- T = temperature of interest (K);\n- T$_{0}$ = reference temperature, usually 298 K.\n- R = 8.314 J/mol/K (universal gas constant);\n\n\n[![](Eq/gibbs.png)](Eq/jsp_gibbs.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

In the latter case, the calculation of parameters and error can be computed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - \\sum x_i \\sum y_i}{n \\sum x_i^2 - \\left( \\sum x_i \\right)^2}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sum y_i - \\alpha \\sum x_i}{n}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_i = \\alpha x_i + \\beta\n$$\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon_i = \\left| y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\right|\n$$\n\n\n\n| A representation for linear adjustment with arbitrary data is provided below:\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/ajLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. Show the points that overlap or do not overlap the fit line. For overlap, choose “showPoints = true” and “showLine = true”;\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit to obtain other parameters of the line.\n```\n\n\n## Nonlinear data fit\n\n### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n| Modeling is a common area of employment in the natural sciences, when mathematical prediction or correlation of experimental data is desired. Models can be linear or non-linear. When non-linear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\n \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual grid search*. In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair \n\\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. As in the previous example, alternately display the points and the adjustment curve using the “Boolean” operation (“showPoints = true/false”; “showCurve = true/false”);\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit to obtain other parameters of the equation (Kd, SSR, R², adjusted R²). Note: R² adj corresponds to the value of R² corrected for the number of parameters in the model (in this case, “2”), directly affecting the “degrees of freedom” for the fit.\n```\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"jsptl_bioq_en.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Índice","toc-title-website":"Nesta
