Here is an example of polynomial regression with adjustable degrees in the code.\n\n### Equation\n\n| Error minimization for the polynomial curve is obtained by generalized *least squares regression* and application of the *Vandermonde matrix*, as follows.\n\n| Let the vectors x=[x$_{1}$,x$_{2}$,…,x$_{n}$] and y=[y$_{1}$,y$_{2}$,…,y${_n}$] be the desired polynomial:\n\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_g x^g\n$$\n| Thus, the Vandermonde matrix is constructed as:\n\n$$\nX =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \\cdots & x_1^g \\\\\\\\\n1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \\cdots & x_2^g \\\\\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \\cdots & x_n^g\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\n\n| To find the *coefficients $\\beta$* that minimize the quadratic error, solve the linear system in sequence:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n- *T* represents the transposed matrix\n\\\n\n\n\n[![](Eq/polinomial.png)](Eq/jsp_polinomial.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

The procedure involves a *design matrix* (or *projection operator*) similar to the *Vandermonde matrix*.\n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The analytical solution for the design matrix involves solving a matrix of coefficients $\\beta$ for a set of predictor values of the response vector *y*, as follows:\n\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{pi} + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n- $\\beta$ = coefficient vector;\n- *y* = response vector;\n- *X* = design matrix;\n- $\\epsilon$ = random noise\n\n\n| Thus, predicted values and associated error are obtained by:\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\n\n\n| Obviously, the graphical representation for a multilinear fit is limited to two independent variables, *x1* and *x2*, in addition to the response variable (*3D graph*), although the matrix calculation allows for several predictor variables (hyperdimensional space). Tangential to the first situation, here is an example.\n\n**Instructions**\n- 1. Note that there is a Boolean flag (*showFit*) at the beginning of the code: *false* for data only, and *true* for the fit.\n- 2.

If you want to increase, add a new vector in the corresponding line and update the quantity in the mapping of “const X = x1.map((_, i)”.\n```\n\n\n\n## Response Surface Methodology (RSM)\n\n| A variation of multilinear adjustment involves the *response surface methodology*, commonly linear (flat) or quadratic (curvilinear), applied in modeling and optimization of experimental processes with multiple independent variables. Its objective is to fit a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between the experimental factors and the response variable, allowing behaviors to be predicted and optimal conditions to be identified. \n\n| For experiments with two factors, a second-order quadratic model is commonly used, which allows surfaces with curvature to be represented. The central idea of the experiment is to select values and their codes (-1,0,1), representing, respectively, a quantity below, an average quantity, and a quantity above, for a given predictor variable.\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The general quadratic model for two factors is represented by:\n\n\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\n| With the matrix form of the model represented by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n\n| And the estimation of the coefficients $\\beta$ by least squares, similar to multilinear adjustment, by:\n\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n$$\n\\\n\n\n\n\n[![](Eq/msr.png)](Eq/jsp_msr.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

In this case, there is no analytical equation that describes the behavior of the signal, although some digital processing tools can rely on a trend curve in data processing, significantly reducing the noise level, such as by *spline curve* and *Savitzky-Golay filter*. \n\n\n### Context - Cubic spline {.unnumbered}\n\n| A very common interpolation technique involves the use of cubic splines by degree 3 polynomials interconnecting data windows. The treatment consists of applying polynomial functions to subintervals of the points, promoting smoothing between the data windows. Mathematically, the spline is applied in such a way that:\n\n$$\nS_i(x) = a_i + b_i(x - x_i) + c_i(x - x_i)^2 + d_i(x - x_i)^3\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n- S$_{i}$(x) = cubic spline function in the interval *[xi,xi+1]*;\n- a$_{i, b$_{i}$, c$_{i}$, d$_{i}$ = specific coefficients for segment *i*;\n- x$_{i}$ = starting point of the interval;\n- *x* = independent variable.\n\n\n### Context - Savitzky-Golay filter\n\n| The Savitzky-Golay filter smoothing technique applies a local polynomial regression to a moving window, using least squares and a predetermined degree, preserving peak, valley, and band signals. Unlike cubic splines, the filter produces a continuous global curve, rather than a set of interconnected curves. Mathematically:\n\n\n$$\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\sum_{j=-m}^{m} c_j \\cdot y_{i+j}\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- y$_{i}$ = smoothed value at position *i*;\n- y$_{i+j}$ = actual values of the series within the window;\n- c$_{i}$ = filter coefficients derived from a polynomial regression;\n- *m* = number of points on each side of the central window.\n\n| Here is an example of code for *JSplotly* that illustrates the use of the two interpolation methods.\n\n[![](Eq/splineGolay.png)](Eq/jsp_splineGolay.html){target=“_blank”}\n\\\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- 1.

Once statistical information indicating that there is a difference between groups greater than the internal difference has been obtained, a *post hoc* test is performed to compare means, such as the *Tukey-HSD test* (*Honest Significant Difference*). \n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The equation that characterizes a Tukey-HSD test is provided below (correction for unbalanced groups):\n\n\n$$\n\\text{HSD}_{ij} = q_{\\alpha} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{MS}_{\\text{within}}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i} + \\frac{1}{n_j} \\right)}\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- HSD = minimum value of the difference between two means for it to be considered significant;\n- q$_{\\alpha}$ = critical value of the studentized distribution *q* (Tukey distribution), depending on the number of groups and the significance level $\\alpha$;\n- MS$_{within}$ = mean square within groups (error) obtained from ANOVA;\n- n: number of observations per group (*i* and *j* if there are groups of different sizes).\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/tukey.png)](Eq/jsp_tukey.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

Models can be linear or nonlinear. When nonlinear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from an explanatory mathematical function of the model. \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and treatment of data (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n### Context: Ligand-protein interaction (*grid search* algorithm) {.unnumbered}\n\n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual grid search*. In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair (a, b) in a previously defined grid (combination table), allowing the identification of the parameters that best describe the experimental data according to the minimum error criterion.\n\\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.

Change the data and perform a new fit to obtain other parameters of the equation (Kd, SSR, R², adjusted R²). Note: R² adj corresponds to the value of R² corrected for the number of parameters in the model (in this case, “2”), directly affecting the “degrees of freedom” for the fit.\n```\n\\\n\n\n### Context - Competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics (Gauss-Newton algorithm) {.unnumbered}\n \n\n\n| The *Gauss-Newton* method iteratively fits nonlinear models to experimental data sets. It is especially efficient when the model is *quasi-linear* with respect to the parameters and the residuals are moderately small. The goal is to find the parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals between the observed data *yi* and the values predicted by the model f(xi,$\\theta$. Unlike the full Newton-Raphson method, Gauss-Newton avoids the explicit calculation of the Hessian by using an approximation based on the Jacobian of the residuals.\n\n\n## Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| This approximation results in a linear system that can be solved at each iteration to update the model parameters. The central formula of the method consists of multiplying the transposed Jacobian *JT* by the Jacobian *J* itself, forming a symmetric matrix that approximates the Hessian. The residual vector *r* is then used to determine the update direction $\\Delta\\theta$, with the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k + \\left(J^T J\\right)^{-1} J^T \\cdot r\n$$\n\n| To illustrate the potential of the application in iterative nonlinear fitting, here is an example for enzyme kinetics using a *competitive inhibition model*. \n\n| The code allows you to adjust the *seeds*, *tolerance*, and number of *iterations*, and provides the graph (points/fitted line, manually), and statistical parameters of the regression.\n\\\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- 1.

In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair (a, b) in a previously defined grid (combination table), allowing the identification of the parameters that best describe the experimental data according to the minimum error criterion.\n\\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1. As in the previous example, alternately display the points and the adjustment curve using the “Boolean” operation (“showPoints = true/false”; “showCurve = true/false”);\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit to obtain other parameters of the equation (Kd, SSR, R², adjusted R²). Note: R² adj corresponds to the value of R² corrected for the number of parameters in the model (in this case, “2”), directly affecting the “degrees of freedom” for the fit.\n```\n\\\n\n\n### Context - Competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics (Gauss-Newton algorithm) {.unnumbered}\n \n\n\n| The *Gauss-Newton* method iteratively fits nonlinear models to experimental data sets. It is especially efficient when the model is *quasi-linear* with respect to the parameters and the residuals are moderately small. The goal is to find the parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals between the observed data *yi* and the values predicted by the model f(xi,$\\theta$. Unlike the full Newton-Raphson method, Gauss-Newton avoids the explicit calculation of the Hessian by using an approximation based on the Jacobian of the residuals.\n\n\n## Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| This approximation results in a linear system that can be solved at each iteration to update the model parameters. The central formula of the method consists of multiplying the transposed Jacobian *JT* by the Jacobian *J* itself, forming a symmetric matrix that approximates the Hessian. The residual vector *r* is then used to determine the update direction $\\Delta\\theta$, with the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k + \\left(J^T J\\right)^{-1} J^T \\cdot r\n$$\n\n| To illustrate the potential of the application in iterative nonlinear fitting, here is an example for enzyme kinetics using a *competitive inhibition model*. \n\n| The code allows you to adjust the *seeds*, *tolerance*, and number of *iterations*, and provides the graph (points/fitted line, manually), and statistical parameters of the regression.\n\\\n\n**Instructions**\n\n- 1. Note that the code has a flag for *true/false* in the *ajuste* constant. I left it at *false* for data representation only (vectors *x* and *y*, or *S* and *v*);\n- 2. In the *Plot* area of the code, set the *trace* constant so that it also includes the data vectors;\n- 3. Click *add plot* to view the experimental points;\n- 4. To superimpose the fitted curve, update the constants *ajuste* and *trace* (vectors *S_fit* and *v_fit*), and choose *lines* in *mode*.\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLinGauss2.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLinGauss2.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":2,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"jsptl_bioq_en.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
