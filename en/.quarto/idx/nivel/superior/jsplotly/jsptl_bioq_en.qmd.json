In this equation, coefficients are calculated that estimate the existence of a volume and interparticle interactions.

Models can be linear or non-linear. When non-linear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\n \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual scan least squares*. In this treatment, the *sum of the least squares errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair (a, b) in a previously defined grid (combination table), allowing the identification of the parameters that best describe the experimental data according to the minimum error criterion.\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.
