In this equation, coefficients are calculated that estimate the existence of a volume and interparticle interactions.

EIS provides information about interfacial processes, such as charge transfer, ion diffusion, and passive film formation, by analyzing the complex impedance of the system. It is a non-destructive technique widely used in areas such as corrosion, batteries, fuel cells, biosensors, and protective coatings. \n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n| An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent circuit components constitutes the modified Randles model: series resistor *Rs*, a resistor *Rp* in parallel with a *CPE* (Constant Phase Element), and a *Warburg* element. A common representation for EIS is the *Nyquist* plot, where the real axis represents resistance (Zre) and the imaginary axis represents negative reactance (−Zim). The formalism involved is in the equation below:\n\n\n$$\nZ_{\\text{total}}(\\omega) = R_s + \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + Q (j\\omega)^n \\right)^{-1} \\right] + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega}} (1 - j)\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- Z$_{total}$ = total impedance at a given frequency;\n- $\\omega$ = angular frequency (rad/s), $\\omega$=2πf or $\\omega$=2πf;\n- R$_{p}$ = ohmic resistance (resistance of the electrolytic solution, wires, contacts, etc.);\n- R$_{p}$ = Polarization resistance (associated with charge transfer processes, such as electrochemical reactions);\n- *Q* = Constant associated with the constant phase element (CPE), replaces an ideal capacitor to represent non-ideal behaviors;\n- *n* = CPE exponent, between 0 and 1; defines the degree of ideality of the capacitive behavior (n = 1: ideal capacitor; n < 1: dispersion);\n- $\\sigma$ = Warburg coefficient, associated with ion diffusion in the electrochemical system;\n- *j* = Imaginary unit, j$^{2}$ = −1;\n\n\n| An electrochemical impedance model (EIS) with typical equivalent circuit components constitutes the modified Randles model: series resistor *Rs*, a resistor *Rp* in parallel with a *CPE* (Constant Phase Element), and a *Warburg* element.

Models can be linear or non-linear. When non-linear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\n \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual grid search*. In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods.

EIS provides information about interfacial processes, such as charge transfer, ion diffusion, and passive film formation, by analyzing the complex impedance of the system. It is a non-destructive technique widely used in areas such as corrosion, batteries, fuel cells, biosensors, and protective coatings. \n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n| An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent circuit components constitutes the modified Randles model: series resistor *Rs*, a resistor *Rp* in parallel with a *CPE* (Constant Phase Element), and a *Warburg* element.

Models can be linear or non-linear. When non-linear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\n \n\n| In this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as *Simplex*, *Gauss*, *Newton-Raphson*, *Levenberg-Marquardt*, or *least squares*, for example. Regardless of the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation [here](https://bioquanti.netlify.app/pt/nivel/superior/r/enzimas#ajuste-n%C3%A3o-linear).\n \n\n| The following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by *manual grid search*. In this treatment, the *sum of the quadratic errors (RMSE)* is calculated for combinations of *a* and *b*, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but using *grid search* rather than classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair \n\\\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\n$$\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n$$\n*Where:*\n\n- Y = fraction of occupied sites;\n- X = concentration of free ligand;\n- *a* = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\n- *Kd* = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\n\n\n| In this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\n$$\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n*SSR* = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/ajNonLin.png)](Eq/jsp_ajNonLin.html){target=“_blank”}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n1.
