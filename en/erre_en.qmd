| *Reproducible Teaching (RT)* defines an active methodology in teaching and learning that combines programming language with descriptive content.
\

| In a sentence: **code for content.**
\

| In practice, RE involves applying text-based code to a program to generate a *product of educational interest*, such as a graph, table, media file, formatted text (PDF, DOCX, EPUB), static or interactive content, simulation, animation, and more. This makes it possible for a student to repeat the execution of the code in a specific program, change part of the code to observe a different result, or even create new code to achieve a different end result.
\

| *Reproducible Teaching* should be practiced openly, involving freely distributed programs or applications and, preferably, using a simple internet browser, to enable its use by as many people as possible, without machine configuration restrictions, and allowing access from both desktop computers and notebooks as well as mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
\


## Learning stages in reproducible teaching

| Computer programs, for mobile applications or web applications, should allow learners to fully integrate content previously developed by an instructor (or group). In this way, learners can progressively acquire digital and content-related skills, such as those listed in the table below:
\


```{r, echo = FALSE}
## #| label: tbl-etapas
#| tbl-cap: "Suggested stages for skills acquired through progressive use of tools in *RE*."
library(knitr)
Stages <- c(1,2,3,4) # table construction
Skills <- c("1 - execution of code snippets by simple action (copy/paste), and even insertion of code directly into *snippets* for reproduction/editing on a web page (JavaScript): ability to reproduce results (calculations, equations, graphs, tables, diagrams, etc.), as in static information found in textbooks and scientific articles", "2 - execution with modification of text, parameters, and variables: ability to understand the problem under analysis and prospect for new tentative results", "3 - code modification: basic programming skills, code improvement, and algorithm analysis", "4 - code creation and use of packages: consolidated programming skills and use of advanced features of the chosen program")
table2 <- data.frame(Stages, Skills)
knitr::kable(table2, 'pipe',
align = 'l',
)
```

## *ERЯƎ* ... {.unnumbered}
\

| The acronym ERЯƎ suggests the initials for *Reproducible Teaching*, with the font arranged in a palindrome, and with the clear intention of suggesting the exercise of *libertarian error*. It also intends to playfully arrange the analogy of responsible and sustainable development principles of the *3 Rs*. Here, because these are codes for content in *ER*, with the meaning of *reuse (copy), recycle (alteration), or reinvent (recreation)*. Ah! And the little eyes on the "RЯ"... just to associate the wisdom of the owl, or the focus and precision of a bird of prey!
